      The first step in the management of periodontal disease involves the non-surgical removal of
      the soft and hard bacterial deposits at all supra- and sub-gingival sites, especially into
      deep pockets, which can be carried on with different instruments.

      Unfortunately it seems that, after the initial therapy, many patients still present with
      active pockets (residual pockets) requiring further treatment and posing a risk of disease
      progression. This might be due to limitations of the instruments applied and patient-related
      factors. Air-polishing with low-abrasiveness powders seems to be very effective in the
      removal of supra- and sub-gingival biofilm and could provide additional benefits during the
      treatment of pockets.

      The aim of this randomized, controlled, split-mouth study was to compare the efficacy of
      full-mouth air-polishing followed by ultrasonic debridement (GBT) versus traditional Scaling
      and Root Planing (SRP), in terms of pocket closure in patients with stage III-IV
      periodontitis.

      To test this hypothesis, the mouth of each patients, upon initial evaluation, were divided in
      2 parts:

        1. The control group undergoing a standard procedure: ultrasonic debridement with an
           ultrasonic scaler for remove supra and sub gingival calculus, manual debridement with
           curettes at deep pathological pockets (PPD > 4mm) and rubber cup with polishing to
           remove supra gingival biofilm and plaque.

        2. The study group undergoing the innovative air polishing procedure: airflow with
           erythritol powder to remove supra and sub gingival biofilm and plaque, perioflow at deep
           pathological pockets (PPD > 4mm) and ultrasonic debridement with an ultrasonic scaler
           for remove supra and sub gingival calculus.

      The prevalence of residual pockets will be evaluated at 6 weeks and 3 months after the
      initial therapy and compared between the two groups.

      TRIAL DESIGN:

      A prospective, single-masked, randomized, split-mouth, longitudinal clinical trial.

      OUTCOME:

        1. The primary outcome was the number of experimental sites (PPD >4mm and <10mm) becoming
           closed pockets (PPD ≤ 4mm) at 6 weeks (T1) and 3 months (T2) after initial therapy.

        2. Secondary outcomes were the variations in PPD, REC (Clinical Gingival Recession), CAL
           (Clinical Attachment Level), BOP (Bleeding On Probing) and PI (Plaque Index) at the
           experimental sites and treatment time.

      A 10% difference in the primary outcome between the two protocols was set as the threshold to
      define inferiority/non-inferiority of the Test treatment.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      thirty-two (32) adults, aged 18-75 years, will be entered into study (randomized).

      Randomized subjects who deviate from the protocol (major protocol deviation) and, for this
      reason, are excluded from the analysis, will be replaced to guarantee that the sample
      required for the analysis (32) is reached.

      The goal of the present study was to assess the associations of dispositional mindfulness,
      diabetes distress, and glycemic outcomes for adolescents with type 1 diabetes as well as to
      use an iterative approach to developing a self-led scalable mindfulness-based intervention. A
      self-led mindfulness-based intervention may provide a mindfulness practice to help
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes improve glycemic outcomes through diabetes distress
      reduction while also being practical within a pediatric endocrinology clinic. A self-led
      intervention may also reduce the burden associated with mindfulness-based interventions. This
      is important considering the heightened emotional and time burden adolescents may already
      experience due to disease management and the intensity of a traditional mindfulness-based
      intervention.

      The investigators will carry out a prospective, household cluster-randomized, implementation
      trial evaluating a complex, multi-component, social and behavioral intervention designed to
      normalize the acceptance of HIV testing in the household and increase diagnosis of HIV.
    ","August 30, 2022",Actual,"[""Tuberculosis""]","
      An estimated 39 million people worldwide are living with HIV, but nearly half do not know
      their status because they are unaware that they are at risk, unable to access counseling and
      testing, or unwilling to accept testing because of stigma and fear. Layered on to the stigma
      of HIV is the risk of tuberculosis (TB), the leading cause of death among persons living with
      HIV (PLWH). Home testing is a promising approach to increase testing and linkage to care for
      HIV because it can reach individuals outside the health system, eliminate the costs of
      traveling for testing, offer testing in a familiar environment, and increase engagement with
      care among those found to be living with HIV. Nevertheless, many individuals offered home HIV
      testing in sub-Saharan Africa decline to test.

      The investigators developed a complex intervention to increase uptake of testing for HIV
      among household members by reducing perceptions of stigma associated with HIV and testing for
      HIV. The intervention involves lay health workers (LHWs) delivering a novel invitation
      strategy for HIV testing in households that includes 1) acceptance-optimized sequencing, 2)
      prosocial messaging, and 3) salivary HIV testing. The investigators will administer HIV and
      TB stigma scales before and after the invitation. The investigators will conduct a household
      randomized controlled trial to test the intervention's impact on household HIV stigma and
      uptake of testing among household members undergoing TB contact investigation. The
      investigators will measure our co-primary outcomes of HIV and TB stigma using standardized
      instruments before invitation and after completion of post-test counseling. The investigators
      will measure the proportion consenting to HIV testing, yield of HIV diagnoses, and the
      proportion of new PLWH linked to HIV care at 1 month and reassess household HIV and TB stigma
      at 3 months.

      This study will be conducted in Kampala, Uganda, and will involve TB index patients and their
      household contacts. Households will be recruited and enrolled through index patients
      initiating treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) at Kampala Capital City Authority
      health facilities. The investigators will enroll index patients and their households from
      Kiswa, Kawaala, and Kisenyi Health Centers, each a public-sector, primary care facility.

      This study will enroll households (index patients + their household contacts). Only household
      contacts are eligible for participation; close contacts are not eligible. For the purposes of
      this study, household contacts are defined as those individuals ""sleeping under the same
      roof"" as the index patient for one or more nights within the past three months.

      Upon encountering a patient initiating treatment for TB or returning for 2-week follow-up,
      study CHWs will assess index patients for household-level eligibility for the study. All
      index patients whose households meet these criteria will be asked to provide verbal consent
      after reviewing an information sheet. If the index patient is a minor (age < 18 years), the
      guardian of the index patient will be asked to provide verbal consent.

      After study enrollment, a CHW will work with the index patient and, if available, treatment
      supporter to schedule the home visit. Households will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      CHW teams to receive the intervention or standard or care strategy.

      After the enrollment of the household through the index patient, household contact
      investigation will take place. All household contacts who meet these criteria will be asked
      to provide verbal consent after reviewing an information sheet. If the contact is a minor
      (aged 15-17), he or she will be asked to provide verbal assent with his/her parent/guardian
      providing consent. Enrolling in the study does not require eligibility for or consent to HIV
      testing. Those who choose to participate in the study and are eligible for HIV testing will
      be subsequently offered testing and may consent or decline. Those who choose to participate
      in the study and report conditions that render them ineligible for HIV testing, such as
      already known to be a PLWH, testing negative within the last three months, or currently in TB
      treatment, will not be offered HIV testing but will be eligible to participate in other study
      procedures.

      Variable block randomization will be done at the level of the household and will be performed
      at the time of household enrollment. Block sizes will have a minimum of 4 households, a
      maximum of 8 households. The investigators will utilize Study Randomizer, an online
      randomization tool with concealed allocation, to generate the allocation sequence. When a CHW
      determines that an index patient is eligible for the study, and after the index patient or
      guardian has provided verbal informed consent, the CHW will place a phone call to the study
      coordinator. The study coordinator will then enroll the household using the Study Randomizer
      tool and let the CHW know the study allocation. The CHW will then record the appropriate
      allocation in the survey software, along with the randomization ID, and contact the
      appropriate CHW team for the household visit. The index patient will be given the name of the
      community health worker who will be visiting the household, and immediately connected with
      that person by telephone to arrange the home visit.

      Households randomized to intervention group (Social Support Group) will be offered the
      social-behavioral intervention. Households randomized to the standard of care group (Standard
      of Care) will be offered oral testing without any social-behavioral intervention. CHWs will
      operate in teams that are always assigned to the same arm of the study. There will be three
      teams of CHWs in total: one intervention group, one standard of care group, and one
      clinic-based group that will always carry out initial enrollment of index patients and record
      any clinic follow-up by individuals in either arm of the study.

      Regardless of intervention or control arm, CHWs will deliver a short, 13-item TB and HIV
      stigma scale to all household contacts at the beginning (prior to TB evaluation) and end of
      the household visit (after all TB and HIV procedures). The scale was adapted from the Van Rie
      TB HIV stigma scale specifically for this context. The scales will be administered first at
      the beginning of the home visit, then again at its conclusion.

      The primary outcome is uptake of HIV testing, defined as the proportion of eligible
      individuals in the household who undergo testing after a test offer compared between the
      intervention arm and the standard of care arm..

      To determine whether Airglove™ warming device dilates upper limb veins to the same degree as
      the warm water immersion (WWI) method.
    ","April 16, 2019",Actual,,"
      Failure to cannulate to gain intra-venous access is a common occurrence in patients
      undergoing chemotherapy, obese patients, intravenous drug users and those with chronic
      medical problems leading to peripheral venous collapse. Difficulty in gaining IV-access is a
      serious medical consequence since important life-saving drugs, fluids, blood transfusions,
      and other medication are usually given via the intravenous route. Most chemotherapy units in
      the UK rely on venous dilation by immersing the forearm of patients with ""difficult to
      cannulate veins"" (DTCV) into a bucket of warm water. There are however, limitations in this
      method such as controlling water temperature and ensuring proper sterility.

      A new device Airglove™ has been developed which directs warm air over the forearm in a
      polythene sleeve causing venodilation. Preliminary studies in chemotherapy patients suggest
      that the Airglove™ causes venodilation to the extent of the warm water immersion technique,
      however further evidence is required with testing on normal healthy volunteers.

      Aims and Objectives:

      To determine whether Airglove™ warming device dilates upper limb veins to the same degree as
      the warm water immersion (WWI) method.

      Brief Summary .

      This experiment aims to use two different teaching methods to intervene in students' learning
      and find out which teaching method is more conducive to improving students' written test
      achievement. The experiment will use a 6-the investigator seek workshop intervention to
      enhance students' written test achievement. The investigation is divided into workshop groups
      and standard teaching groups. The most significant difference better investigators the two
      groups are that the workshop group has oral links and guarantees. The similarities between
      investigators in the two groups are teacher qualifications, intervention time, content, and
      research objects.

      Based on content knowledge learning, content knowledge is divided into six categories for
      detailed intervention. First, the investigators will do a 6-the investigator seek
      intervention for two groups (workshop style and standard teaching style). The difference
      better investigators two is whether there is a video teaching link, and the same is that
      there are oral links. The entire experiment was carried out in the classroom with the
      school's consent. Use written exams to check student scores. Students have special teachers
      responsible for teaching specific content knowledge during class, standard learning after
      class does not require special care, and the experiment is not risky.

      Hypothesis including as follow:1 ) General Hypothesis. There is no significant difference in
      the written test results of the prior theoretical knowledge 、health promotion knowledge、
      physical exercise knowledge control group, with experimental group performance among PE
      students in China. 2) Specific Hypothesis. The specific hypothesis of this study is to
      investigate the effect of a 6-weeks content knowledge workshop on written test performance
      among PE students in China. The detailed hypothesis is: There is no significant difference
      between the control and experimental groups in the sports training design、the teaching design
      、the muscle function system、the exercise physiology、the competition venue planning、the
      referee rules written test performance among PE students in China.

      Detailed Description

      Location.The University of China. In terms of students, the proportion of people who choose
      to work is high, while the proportion of people who choose to continue their postgraduate
      entrance tests is negligible. Sports graduates account for 70% of a Province, and students
      have not participated in workshop study. On the school side, the school has perfect teaching
      equipment to meet the experimental requirements, conducive to better completion.

      The analysis of intervention Plan-same characteristics mainly includes two parts: Teacher
      qualification and student qualifications. In the first part, workshop group and standard
      teaching group, teacher Qualification, same qualification and titles, both have one same
      teacher majors: physical education, similar experience: minimum more than ten years.No
      students have received this courses before the study. The second part is the age, major and
      educational background of students. For example, students with similar educational
      backgrounds, aged 19 and 25, are all majors in physical education.No students have received
      these courses before the study.

      This part discusses the details of the 6-the investigator seeks workshop and standard
      teaching intervention. First and foremost, CK includes three categories. Then, the deeper
      level is divided into six parts: methods and plans, class hour teaching plan, muscle
      exercise, energy supply, breathing and exercise circulation and exercise, athletic and
      basketball venue, basketball, and football rules. On the other hand, there are two lessons;
      each class is 1.5 hours.

      This is a one-class training plan, mainly divided into other structures. A training session
      explicitly includes three parts.

      To start with, the intervention content includes step 1-An, an overview, and introduction,
      step 2-Students formed groups, step 3-Oral test assessment. The first part includes: The
      teacher introduced the purpose of the study, expectations, and discussion of the principles
      of sports training design. Next, the investigators learn to design, muscle function, and
      exercise physiology system-rest time.

      The second part includes introducing the purpose of the study, expectations, and discussion
      of the principles of sports training design. They the investigators learn content related to
      design and muscle function and exercise physiology systems. Rest time Divided into three
      groups and rotated roles of teacher, students, 8 / group. They the investigators learn by the
      reciprocal peer learning instructional model.

      The third part includes introducing the purpose of the study, expectations, and discussion of
      the principles of sports training design. They the investigators learn content related to
      design and muscle function and exercise physiology systems. Rest time Divided into three
      groups and rotated roles of teacher, students, 8 / group. They the investigators learn by the
      reciprocal peer learning instructional model. Students the investigators prompted to switch
      teacher roles, student every 10 min-evaluation through check sheets and oral test ( 90% or

      In this web-based RCT, the investigators will investigate whether promoting an active choice
      regarding coping with an increased CVD risk results in better psychological outcomes (e.g.,
      degree of active choice; commitment toward the chosen option) compared to usual care (i.e., a
      GP's advice to change one's lifestyle and take medication). By 'active choice' the
      investigators mean a conscious and autonomous choice in which an individual (a) becomes aware
      of a discrepancy between the current and desired situation; (b) understands what his/her CVD
      risk means, and what its causes and consequences are; (c) evaluates the pros and cons of the
      different options to cope with the risk; and (d) is clear about his/her values regarding the
      choice. The different options to cope with an increased CVD risk include: changing one's
      lifestyle; taking medication; doing both; or changing nothing.
    ","February 8, 2022",Actual,"[""Cardiovascular Diseases""]","
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of mortality among adults.
      Adults at increased risk of cardiovascular disease are usually advised by their general
      practitioner (GP) to change their lifestyle (i.e., quit smoking; eat healthier; become more
      physically active). In addition, GP's regularly advice their patients to take
      antihypertensive and/or lipid lowering medication to decrease the CVD risk. Previous research
      has shown that many patients at increased risk of CVD have difficulty maintaining lifestyle
      changes and adhering to their medication regimen - either intentionally or unintentionally.
      Intentional non-adherence could occur when patients experience side-effects of the
      medication, whereas unintentional non-adherence usually occurs when patients forget to take
      their medication.

      In the current study, the investigators will investigate whether promoting an active choice
      regarding coping with an increased CVD risk results in better psychological outcomes (e.g.,
      degree of active choice; commitment toward the chosen option) compared to usual care (i.e. a
      GP's advice to change one's lifestyle and take medication). By 'active choice' the
      investigators mean a conscious and autonomous choice in which an individual (a) becomes aware
      of a discrepancy between the current and desired situation; (b) understands what his/her CVD
      risk means, and what its causes and consequences are; (c) evaluates the pros and cons of the
      different options to cope with the risk; and (d) is clear about his/her values regarding the
      choice. The different options to cope with an increased CVD risk include: changing one's
      lifestyle; taking medication; doing both; or changing nothing.

      The investigators will investigate this in a web-based RCT among adults aged 45-65 years. The
      intervention group (i.e. active choice group) and control group (i.e. usual care group) will
      both receive a hypothetical CVD risk. The investigators expect an active choice regarding
      coping with an increased CVD risk to result in better psychological outcomes compared to a
      GP's advice. Ultimately, a more active choice is expected to results in greater behavioural
      persistence regarding the chosen option; i.e. lifestyle change and/or medication adherence.

      The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional stressors and challenges to couples'
      relationships, with potential ripple effects across all family subsystems and child
      adjustment. Among those who are particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower
      relationship satisfaction during this time are couples with young children, whose
      relationships may have already been tenuous prior to the pandemic. The Love Together Parent
      Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing intervention adapted for parents of
      young children, designed to reduce conflict-related distress and prevent relationship
      deterioration. Based on an original writing program by Finkel and colleagues, adaptations
      include intervention duration and study population. The current study will examine key
      feasibility metrics related to this adapted intervention program with the goal of identifying
      problems and informing parameters of future pilot and/or main randomized controlled trials
      (RCT). The current study is a non-randomised feasibility study, using a single-arm,
      pre-test/post-test design to primarily assess the feasibility of a large trial, and
      secondarily to assess the potential effects on outcomes to be used in a future RCT. Couples
      will be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of obtaining a
      socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples to enroll will be included.
      Baseline and post-intervention surveys will be conducted, and a writing intervention will
      take place (three 7-minute sessions over the course of four weeks). The primary feasibility
      metrics will include recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility criteria, sample
      diversity, retention, uptake, and adherence, and acceptability. In addition, the researchers
      will develop an objective primary outcome measure of couple ""we-ness"" based on analysis of
      writing samples. The secondary outcomes will include couples' measures (i.e., relationship
      quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported partner responsiveness,
      conflict-related distress), and other family outcomes (i.e., parent-child relations,
      parental/child mental health, and parenting practices). Criteria for success are outlined and
      failure to meet criteria will result in adaptations to measurement schedule, intervention
      design, recruitment approaches, and/or other elements of the study design. This feasibility
      study will inform several components of the procedures used for a subsequent pilot RCT, which
      will examine the feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g.,
      randomization, attrition to follow up assessment/across groups, and sample size estimation,
      preliminary effectiveness), and a main trial, which will investigate the effectiveness of the
      intervention on primary outcome measures as well as mediating pathways.

      Study design and setting

      From May 2017 to December 2019, 56 patients with morbid obesity were admitted to the
      Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Foggia and underwent laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy. UGI tract radiography with water-soluble contrast medium was performed on
      the second day after the operation to rule out leakage. The radiographic images were
      collected through a software program called ""PACS"" which combined with a viewer for image
      processing, allows for the calculation of the residual stomach area (RSA). RSA was correlated
      with postoperative weight (EWL) at 1, 6, and 12 months.

      Eligibility criteria

      Adult patients of both genders with morbid obesity defined as BMI>40 kg/m2 or BMI>35 kg/m2
      with at least one associated major comorbidity were included. We excluded patients with
      secondary obesity due to endocrine and psychological disorders, patients with previous
      bariatric procedures and patients unwilling to comply with postoperative diet and exercise
      program.

      Statistical analysis

      Continuous data were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) and they were analyzed
      using Student's T test. The correlation between gastric volume before and after LSG and BMI
      and weight loss was measured using Pearson correlation coefficient test. Correlation
      coefficients were classified as strong (-1.0 to -0.5 or 0.5 to 1.0), moderate (-0.5 to -0.3
      or 0.3 to 0.5), and weak (-0.3 to -0.1 or 0.1 to 0.3). P<0.05 was considered statistically
      significant. This work is fully compliant with the STROCSS criteria

      Inflammatory activities in the gastrointestinal tract are accompanied by an increase in blood
      flow in the intestinal wall layers of the respective organs. Also in chronic inflammatory
      bowel diseases, the release of vasoactive inflammatory mediators leads to vasodilation and
      consecutive increase of blood flow in the bowel wall. So far, these changes in blood flow can
      be detected by power Doppler sonography without being part of routine clinical diagnostics.
      Another promising option for non-invasive measurement of blood flow in the intestinal wall is
      Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT). Previous studies have shown that MSOT can be
      used to quantitatively measure hemoglobin in the bowel wall and thus provide information on
      blood flow and inflammatory activity in the intestines of patients with Crohn's disease. This
      is currently being further investigated in a pivotal study (Euphoria, H2020) and could lead
      to the possibility of non-invasive assessment of disease activity in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) in the future.

      The regional blood flow in the intestinal wall and the distribution of gastrointestinal blood
      flow are also subject to strong postprandial changes. During absorption of food components,
      blood flow increases sequentially in the respective sections of the gastrointestinal tract,
      leading to postprandial hyperemia. Because postprandial hyperemia is particularly regulated
      locally by the presence of dietary components, there is a relationship between the sequential
      increase in blood flow in the intestinal wall and the peristaltic transport of chyme through
      the gastrointestinal tract. Postprandial hyperemia could also lead to an increase in the
      optoacoustic hemoglobin signal of the intestinal wall and thus have an impact on the
      assessment of inflammatory activity in IBD using MSOT. Additionally, MSOT allows the
      identification of non-absorbable exogenous chromophores, such as indocyanine green (ICG),
      which could allow co-localization of the chyme in the intestinal lumen after oral application
      of ICG.

      This pilot study investigates whether postprandial blood flow changes can be quantitatively
      measured using MSOT and whether these changes occur simultaneously with the gastrointestinal
      passage of the chyme as measured by the ICG signal in the intestinal lumen.
    ","January 15, 2022",Actual,"[""Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"",""Digestive System Diseases"",""Gastrointestinal Diseases""]","
      The gastrointestinal tract essentially fulfills two major functions: digestion and absorption
      of food, and physical and immunological barrier against environmental influences. These basic
      functions are critically dependent on splanchnic blood flow at both the macrovascular and
      microvascular levels. In particular, advances in vascular biology have revealed a central and
      intricate role of blood circulation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

      Until now, changes in blood flow have been used as surrogate markers for altered inflammatory
      activity in the intestine, e.g., by Doppler sonographic detection. Multispectral Optoacoustic
      Tomograph (MSOT) allows for non-invasive, quantitative imaging of the molecular composition
      of target tissues. In MSOT, similar to conventional sonography, a transducer is placed on the
      skin but energy is delivered to the tissue by means of laser light in the near infrared
      spectrum instead of ultrasound waves. This leads to a constant alternation of minimal
      expansions and contractions (thermoelastic expansion) of individual tissue components or
      molecules. The resulting ultrasound waves can subsequently be detected by the same
      examination unit. Previous studies have shown that quantitative determination of hemoglobin
      can provide information on blood flow and inflammatory activity in the intestine of adult
      patients with Crohn's disease. In particular, the distinction between the activity levels of
      the disease (remission/low/moderate/high) is promising for saving invasive measures in the
      future when evaluating the progression of the disease.

      In addition to inflammatory processes, food intake also causes fluctuations in regional blood
      flow in the gastrointestinal tract. This manifests as postprandial hyperemia, which occurs
      sequentially in the different sections of the gastrointestinal tract from oral to aboral.

      The time course of postprandial hyperemia in the different sections of the gastrointestinal
      tract has been scientifically investigated in many studies. While an increase in blood flow
      in the stomach and duodenum can be detected after 30-60 minutes, it takes much longer for
      postprandial hyperemia to be detected in the areas used to measure inflammatory activity with
      MSOT in IBD such as the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon. An increase in blood flow in the
      ileum can be measured after 120 minutes at the earliest, and the arrival of chyme in the
      colon and the accompanying local increase in blood flow occur after approximately 240-300
      minutes.

      It is unclear whether this postprandial hyperemia can lead to a change and potential increase
      in the optoacoustic hemoglobin signal of the intestinal wall, resulting in falsely high MSOT
      signals in the determination of inflammatory activity. This study investigates influences of
      a standardized dietary on the MSOT signal of the intestinal wall using a longitudinal design.
      Optoacoustic signals will be compared between subjects in fasting and postprandial states.
      Because the postprandial increase in intestinal blood flow is predominantly a result of the
      local presence of chyme in the intestine, a simultaneous determination of intestinal transit
      of chyme during MSOT measurement would be helpful to validate whether postprandial changes in
      MSOT signals are attributable to hyperemia in the corresponding bowel segment. Besides
      imaging of hemoglobin, MSOT enables the detection of exogenous chromophores (i.e. dyes). In
      this study, the oral administration of the nonabsorbable dye indocyanine green (ICG) will be
      used for noninvasive identification of the chyme. The combination of exogenous and endogenous
      chromophores thus allows accurate co-localization and registration of intestinal wall blood
      flow patterns and chyme transit. This information enables accurate anatomical mapping of
      interfering influences on the determination of hemoglobin using MSOT.

      This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using telehealth in the
      care of women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) by providing a self-learning
      alternative via an online portal compared to a one-to-one dietary education, conducted
      face-to-face in a dietitian clinic. The investigators hypothesize that the use of technology
      would enable a higher percentage of women to receive the necessary dietary education, thereby
      empowering behaviour change and resulting in positive maternal blood glucose control and
      pregnancy outcomes.

      The primary hypothesis is that the new care model will reach out to a higher proportion
      compared to the conventional model (Service utilization), as determined by the completion of
      the online self-learning, comparing it to attendance rates with the conventional model.

      The secondary hypothesis is that the new care model will be able to provide care that would
      be comparable to those in the traditional outpatient clinic setting, as measured by the blood
      glucose and pregnancy outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction and patient experience.
    ","August 13, 2021",Actual,"[""Diabetes, Gestational""]","
      GDM is a significant health issue amongst women. Medical nutrition therapy is established as
      the first-line treatment for GDM. The goal is to support maternal and foetal nutrition in
      order to ensure adequate pregnancy weight gain and foetal growth, whilst at the same time,
      maintain optimal glycemic control. Health education continues to play an important role in
      managing GDM. However, not all women with GDM receive dietary education as recommended, due
      to a multitude of personal and circumstantial factors. Failure to attend diabetes-related
      appointment has been associated with poorer glycaemic control by 36 weeks' gestation, which
      leads to a higher risk of macrosomia and an unfavourable set-up for neonatal outcomes.
      Therefore, this pilot study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using
      telehealth in the dietary management of GDM compared with the current standard care, i.e.
      traditional face-to-face dietary education.

      A total of 50 women diagnosed with GDM will be randomized to the standard care or telehealth,
      where self-education will be done via an online portal and subsequently followed up by
      teleconsult. Both groups will be followed up by the dietitian every 2-4 weeks until delivery
      either face-to-face (control group) or telehealth video consultation (intervention group).
      Each participant will be provided with a set of glucometer and the required consumables for
      home blood glucose monitoring.

      Outcomes to determine the success of the study will be the percentage of women who completed
      dietary education. Other outcomes will include birth outcome data - birth weight to assess
      for large-for-gestational age baby, type of delivery, incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia and
      total maternal weight gain, to establish the efficacy of this model of care. The
      effectiveness of self-learning will be assessed using pre- and post-test assessment quizzes.
      The experience and satisfaction of this model will also be surveyed.

      effects on children's mental health problems as well as interparental conflict, parent-child
      relationship quality and effective discipline. The eNBP is an asynchronous, fully web-based

      parent-child relationship quality and effective discipline and reduce children's mental
      health problems in three randomized controlled trials of the NBP involving over 1,800
      children. The investigators hypothesized that parents in the eNBP intervention condition
      would have less interparental conflict and higher parent-child relationship quality and
      effective discipline than those in the wait-list control condition. The investigators also
      expected the children whose parents were in the eNBP intervention condition would have fewer

      Program (eNBP)'s effects on children's mental health problems as well as interparental
      conflict, parent-child relationship quality and effective discipline. The eNBP is an
      asynchronous, fully web-based program that was based on the in-person, group-based NBP. Three
      randomized controlled trials of the NBP involving over 1,800 children found positive effects
      to strengthen parent-child relationship quality and effective discipline and reduce
      children's mental health problems. The eNBP teaches all the skills in the 10-session NBP. The
      investigators hypothesized that parents in the eNBP would have less interparental conflict
      and higher parent-child relationship quality and effective discipline than those in the
      wait-list control condition following the intervention. The investigators also expected the
      children whose parents were in the eNBP would have fewer internalizing problems and
      externalizing problems and higher prosocial skills than those with parents in the wait-list
      control following the intervention.

      Parents and their offspring were recruited using Qualtrics, a leading-edge sample acquisition
      technology that partners with 20 online panel providers and recruits nationally. Initial
      sampling criteria were parent was divorced, separated but never married, divorcing, or
      separating; had one or more children aged 6 to 18; and spoke English. Parents who met these
      criteria were sent an email with information about the study and a web-based survey that
      assessed contact with child/ren, access to a computer with high-speed internet or a smart
      phone and demographics. Interested parents were provided additional information about the
      study and screened for eligibility by phone. To be eligible, parents had to be divorced,
      separated but never married, divorcing or separating; have one or more child between 6 and
      18; be English speaking; spend at least three hours/week or at least one overnight every
      other week with their child(ren); and have access to a computer with high-speed internet or a
      smart phone. The sample consisted of 131 parents randomized to eNBP (N = 81) or wait-list
      condition (N = 50) and 102 of their adolescent offspring.

      Primary outcome measures were measures of interparental conflict, parent-child relationship
      quality, effective discipline and children's internalizing and externalizing problems and
      prosocial behavior.

      This interventional study aims to investigate the tolerance of organic formula milk on
      infants supplemented with organic formula milk. This study also observes gut microbiota,
      short chain fatty acids, nutritional status, and atopic manifestation on infants supplemented
      with organic formula milk. This study will be done on 50 subjects, with an age of 6-7 months
      old, 38-42 weeks of gestation, had a birth weight ranging from 2700 grams to 4200 grams, not
      suffering from any major congenital anomaly, not severely stunted at birth, has a normal
      thyroid function, not suffering any prominent gastrointestinal disease, not having a severe
      disease at the beginning of study, and has an approval from their parents. Participants' diet
      will be added an organic formula for infant for 3 months, and will be monitored regularly,
      since this study starts, at each month, and at the end of this study. The participants' gut
      microbiomes will be calculated at every session of monitoring by collecting their fecal
      samples, and brought to laboratory. Anthropological data (weight, height, body mass index),
      atopic manifestation, IL-6 and IL-10 will also be collected.

      All the guardians or parents of the participants in this study will be interviewed in order
      to record the dietary and sign for inform consent. Parents will be given a journal to record
      the participant's diet, any sign of colic on subjects, quality of sleep, and wellbeing. All
      the participants will be fed organic formula milk as a part of their dietary for 12 weeks.
      Before feeding the formula, the nutritional status will be measured and the participant's
      fecal will be collected for microbiome and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) examination. Every
      month the parents will be called in order to assess for child's sickness, allergy, body
      weight, length, head circumference, and to review their journal.

      A visit follow up will be done before and after the study, the tolerance, nutritional status
      (including body mass index) and fecal collection for all subjects will be performed. The
      investigators will also collect the allergy related data. Each fecal examination will follow
      a strict cold chain procedure, each sample will be collected directly, bottled, and frozen to
      minimize error. The frozen samples will be transported in insulated bags with frozen ice
      blocks before being transferred to -80°C for storage.

      A statistical analysis will be performed using r program and STATA 13.0. The Normality of
      data distribution will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. To evaluate potential
      associations between factors in relation to fecal microbiome or SCFAs, Spearman's rank
      correlations will be calculated. A p-value <0.05 will be considered significant.

      The model will be adjusted for potential confounders. Estimated associations will be
      described as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The non-parametric
      Wilcoxon test for paired samples will be used to compare different laboratory parameters at
      different times of collecting samples. The Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples will be
      applied to compare different categorical parameter between infants before and after
      treatment. Multivariable linear regressions will be done to find out the association of
      different parameters change before and after treatment.

      The quality of caregiving and the parent-child relationship is critical for early child
      development (ECD) and has been shown to be modifiable. This study evaluated an ECD project in
      Tanzania, assessing the effectiveness of radio messaging (RM) alone and a combined radio
      messaging/video job aids/ECD (RMV-ECD) intervention, using a two-arm pre-post design study,
      which enrolled a cohort of caregivers of children 0-24 months in four districts of Tabora
      region, following them for nine months. ECD radio messages were broadcast on popular stations
      at least 10 times/day reaching all study districts. In two districts, community health
      workers (CHW) trained in UNICEF's Care for Child Development package and used ECD videos in
      home- and facility-based sessions with caregivers. Five outcomes were used to assess the
      intervention effects: ECD knowledge, early stimulation, father engagement, responsive care,
      and environment safety. Additionally the effect of the training and video job aids on the
      quality of CHWs' counseling support was evaluated primarily using structured observation
      checklists of household visits and facility group counseling sessions with caregivers and
      their children. Qualitative data was collected from a subset of caregivers and CHW
      participating in the study to assess acceptability and other perceptions of the project.

      Standardized interventions aimed at supporting child development are successful in a variety
      of cultural and socio-economic contexts, particularly in low to middle income countries.
      Integrated community and facility-based interventions can improve parenting behaviors. Mass
      media radio messaging campaigns can increase caregiver and community knowledge, and caregiver
      motivation to seek appropriate health care through reaching a broader audience such as
      family/household influencers such as fathers or grandparents.

      Study design and setting:

      This was a two-arm quasi-experimental pre-post evaluation study, comparing different 9-month
      intervention packages to establish their relative impact on parenting skills and environment
      among a cohort of caregivers of children under age three years in Tabora region, located in
      central-western Tanzania and home to a predominantly rural (87%) population. The study
      included four districts divided into two intervention groups. The first group (Kaliua, Uyui
      districts) was exposed to the minimal intervention package, composed of radio messaging (RM)
      only. The second group (Nzega, Igunga districts) was exposed to the Malezi II full
      intervention package, composed of radio messaging, the introduction of short video job aids
      primarily for community health worker (CHW) use, and the UNICEF Care for Childhood
      Development (CCD) program (RMV-ECD).

      Sample and sampling procedures:

      As the comprehensive program intervention was primarily delivered by CHW who were affiliated
      with health facilities, 31 health facilities were purposefully selected located in 29
      administrative units called wards (6-8/district). From these wards, 75 National Bureau of
      Statistics census enumeration areas (EA) were randomly sampled proportional to population
      size. The study team aimed to enumerate all households in sampled EAs, listing potentially
      eligible households if there was a resident adult (>18 years) primary caregiver of a child
      aged 0-24 months who intended to remain in the same area for at least one year, and was
      willing to be home-visited by a CHW. From these listed households, only one caregiver per
      household was recruited. Caregivers who were not able to provide written informed consent due
      to a cognitive impairment or language barrier; or who were the primary caregiver of an index
      child with a congenital anomaly or other disability; or who worked as a CHW or medical
      provider, were excluded from the study.

      The study team estimated that a completed sample size of 430 caregivers per intervention
      group would provide 90% power to detect a 15% difference between the RM and RMV-ECD
      intervention groups at endline, and >80% power to detect at least a 5% change in each t
      intervention group between baseline and endline, at a 5% significance level. Of 8880
      households enumerated, 1248 caregivers were recruited into the study and interviewed at
      baseline (October-December 2019). Of these, 1051 were eligible for follow-up; 1004 (96%) were
      successfully traced and interviewed at endline (January-March 2021). Almost all (n=985; 98%)
      caregivers interviewed at endline remained the primary caregiver of the index child from
      baseline. Of the 19 caregivers whose index child had died or moved from the household, eight
      nominated an eligible ""replacement"" child under three years and 11 completed a partial
      interview skipping questions that were no longer applicable.

      A cohort of 120 CHWs was also enrolled from the two intervention districts, who were assigned
      to caregiver-cohort enrolled households in the RMV-ECD arm.

      Data collection and study variables Structured questionnaires were administered in a private
      place in or near the consenting caregiver's home in the national language (Swahili). Five
      outcome variables were defined reflecting caregiver knowledge, stimulation practices, father
      engagement, responsive care, and household environment risk. Continuous scores for each
      variable were dichotomized at the median for analysis. Some scores, where the number of items
      differed by age of the child (early stimulation) or sub-group (environment risk), were
      standardized to a 0-1 scale by dividing the raw score by the number of items. The quality of
      CHWs counseling support was evaluated using a structured evaluation checklist, targeting two
      home and two clinic observations for each CHW in each round; pre and post intervention. The
      checklist had 23 items across 6 dimensions; introduce, educate, ask, plan/problem solve,
      interact/encourage, and responsive care. Under the qualitative process evaluation, 25
      in-depth interviews (IDI) were completed with caregivers enrolled in the cohort, and four
      focus group discussions (FGD) were held among those in the CHW cohort.

      Background: Studies have revealed that time-restricted feeding affects the fat oxidation
      rate; however, its effects on the fat oxidation rate and hyperlipidemia following high-fat
      meals are unclear. This study investigated the effects of 5-day time-restricted feeding on
      the fat oxidation rate and postprandial lipemia following high fat meals. Methods: In this
      random crossover experimental study, eight healthy male adults were included each in the
      5-day time-restricted feeding trial and the control trial. The meals of the time-restricted
      feeding trial were provided at 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00. The meals of the control trial were
      provided at 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00. The contents of the meals of both trials were the same,
      and the calories of the meals met the 24-hour energy requirement of the participants. After 5
      days of the intervention, the participants consumed high-fat meals on the sixth day, and
      their physiological changes were determined.
    ","February 3, 2022",Actual,"[""Hyperlipidemias""]","
      The experiment was conducted over 6 days. On the first day, the participants arrived at the
      laboratory at 08:00 and quietly rested for 20 minutes in the supine position; gas analyzers
      were used to record their energy consumption. Subsequently, the participants were randomly
      allocated to the time-restricted feeding trial or the control trial. The meals of the
      time-restricted feeding trial were provided at 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00, and the participants
      were required to consume all the food during this time. The meals of the control trial were
      provided at 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00, but the consumption time was not limited. In addition to
      regular meals, a snack with approximately 200 calories was provided to the participants for
      consumption. The participants in the time-restricted feeding trial were only allowed to
      consume the snack from 12:00 to 20:00, whereas no restrictions were imposed on the control
      trial for snack consumption. The meals of the participants were provided by dieticians. Based
      on the results of the pretest, the calories of each meal met the daily energy requirement of
      the participants. The macronutrient consumption for TRF and CON were listed in table 1.

      After experiment completion on the fifth day, the participants returned to the laboratory on
      the eighth day from 08:00 to 09:00. They rested for 10 minutes in the supine position, and
      gas analyzers were used to collect the gas data of the participants for 20 minutes. Next, a
      catheter was inserted into the forearm of each participant to collect fasting blood samples.
      After blood sample collection, the participants were provided with a specific high-fat meal.
      The participants rested quietly in the laboratory for 4 hours, and their blood lipid changes

      Interventions to promote physical activity among women breast cancer survivors (BCS) in low
      to middle-income countries are limited. We conducted a study to assess the acceptability and
      preliminary effectiveness of an 8-week, 3 times/week group dance intervention for BCS
      delivered in Bogotá, Colombia. The effect of the intervention on participants' physical
      activity levels, motivation to engage in physical activity, and quality of life were
      evaluated, and interviews were thematically analyzed to assess program acceptability.

      This is a quasi-experimental study with a control group and an intervention group.

      The study population are patients over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of breast cancer who
      have received management and are currently in remission phase (more than 1 year after
      finishing management with chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and who do not report having any
      medical contraindication for the practice of physical activity (angina, acute myocardial
      infarction, pulmonary embolism, arterial hypertension and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
      severe lymphedema). The control group will be patients who attend their medical check-ups at
      the National Cancer Institute of Colombia and the intervention group will be patients who are
      cared for by units of the Bogotá's medical service. It will have the written approval of the
      ethics committee of the respective hospitals.

      Being an exploratory study that investigates the acceptability and main motivations for
      attending physical activity sessions on a regular basis, it is considered that a sample of 30
      people in the control group and 30 people in the intervention group could provide the
      necessary information to have in mind to develop studies with more significant sample sizes
      in the future.

      For 8 weeks the intervention group will be offered 24 classes of musicalized directed
      physical activity (through a training protocol adapted for patients with this underlying
      pathology), and 8 craft workshops, to be held in the same space as the physical activity
      sessions. Additionally, at the same time, healthy habits will be promoted with the control
      group through text messages during 8 weeks, with a two workshops (at the beginning and the
      end of this period). The classes and workshops will be held at the facilities of the health
      provider institution in a place that guarantees the privacy of the participants.

      For the recruitment of patients in the intervention group, women who were diagnosed with
      altered BI-RADS will be contacted by telephone. For the recruitment of patients from the
      control group, the head nurse who coordinates the follow-up program for breast cancer
      patients will be asked to invite the women in the study to participate. Additionally, all
      invited patients will receive the information through an attached information sheet.

      Before the start of the intervention and after it, the following measurements will be made:

        1. The questionnaires include questions about sociodemographic data, medical information,
           quality of life, general state of health, optimism and pessimism about life, anxiety and
           depression, perception of fatigue, knowledge about physical activity, self-efficacy in
           physical activity and social support for the practice of physical activity. These
           questionnaires will be administered by pollsters trained and registered through the
           Qualtrics application. These questionnaires will be applied by trained interviewers in a
           personal meeting in both health centers, in a space that ensures the confidentiality and
           security of the information.

        2. Objective measurements that include levels of physical activity by accelerometry and
           body composition by bio-impedance. These measurements will be carried out by a
           professional in Respiratory Therapy in the facilities of the institution that provides
           services where the women have been recruited, as appropriate control group or
           intervention group. The research team will provide the transportation service to take
           the participants to the facilities. To guarantee the physical safety of the people who
           participate, there will be a person certified in life support, who will ensure that the
           participant who requires entering in the most efficient way to the health system. It is
           worth clarifying that all study participants will have affiliation to a Health Promoting
           Entity through which they attend their oncology controls, and additionally, the research
           group will have a medical insurance policy for the patients who participate in the
           intervention to cover any event that may arise during it.

        3. Collection of qualitative information through focus groups led by an anthropology
           professional to explore what breast cancer survivors look for in a physical activity
           program and the main motivations and barriers to attending said program and its
           acceptability. In addition, information will be collected through interviews with
           experts who work in health promotion, disease prevention, and cancer patient management
           to identify those factors that are important to be able to articulate the recreation
           sector with the health sector in the implementation of a targeted physical activity
           program for breast cancer survivors. Approximately 10 to 15 interviews will be carried
           out according to the saturation of the information; the recruitment of these experts
           will be done through snowball sampling where an expert will refer to contacts related to
           this topic.

      Statistical analyzes will be carried out with SPSS and SAS, an ANOVA analysis of variance,
      Kruskal-Wallis and McNemar's tests of repeated measures will be carried out to establish the
      change in the results before and after the intervention. To support the analysis of
      qualitative data from both the focus groups and the interviews, the NVIVO12 software will be
      used.

      Participants will receive the aggregated results of the general study ensuring
      confidentiality. Additionally, the participants will receive individually the results of the
      anthropometric tests and stress tests so that they know their physical condition; those who
      find a level of risk of coronary heart disease will be explicitly suggested to consult a

      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting women of all ages worldwide.
      Advanced and comprehensive treatment options have increased survival rate and life
      expectancy, necessitating a focus on the complications of breast cancer treatment. Although
      axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) causes high morbidity, it is an integral part of
      surgical treatment in patients with invasive breast cancer and axillary lymph node
      metastasis. Axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy are associated with pain,
      physical symptoms, and decreased functional abilities in the upper extremity. This study
      aimed to compare the potential effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)
      technique on muscle strength, pain and functionality in this patient group with progressive
      resistance exercise (PRT).
    ","July 1, 2021",Actual,,"
      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting women of all ages worldwide. An
      increase in the incidence of breast cancer is observed with the effect of widespread
      screening programs today. Improved and comprehensive treatment options (surgery,
      radiotherapy, systemic adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy, hormonal therapy) have increased the
      survival rate and life expectancy. This has necessitated a focus on the short, medium and
      long term complications of breast cancer treatment and their management.

      Although axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) causes high morbidity, it is an integral part
      of surgical treatment in patients with invasive breast cancer and axillary lymph node
      metastasis (2). Radiotherapy is routinely used to reduce the local recurrence rate after
      ALND. 73% of the patients who received these treatments reported that they had at least 1
      complaint of limitation of shoulder joint range of motion, loss of strength in the operated
      arm, pain, lymphedema numbness, fibrosis, fatigue, and inability in activities of daily
      living in the postoperative period.

      It is known that the muscle strength of the operated side arm is less than the strength of
      the contralateral extremity and the strength of healthy women due to many reasons such as
      deterioration of the soft tissue integrity of the chest wall with surgery, inactivity
      tendencies of the patients due to protecting the operated arm, adhesions that may occur with
      radiotherapy, and fibrosis formations making movement difficult. In addition, one-third of
      women with breast cancer treated with surgery experience permanent loss of strength in their
      upper extremity muscles for more than 1 year after treatment. According to the results of a
      study investigating the causes of persistent pain after breast cancer treatment, ALND and
      radiotherapy administration are the two main risk factors for persistent pain, and 21% of
      women who have ALND experience persistent shoulder/arm pain throughout their lives. Adequate
      muscle strength and no pain during movement are of great importance for the quality of
      movement and for the smooth performance of daily life activities. In a study on patients'
      evaluation of their own upper extremity functionality, women receiving breast cancer
      treatment stated that they were more functionally limited than their healthy peers and had
      difficulties in activities of daily living. In a study of large populations, it was reported
      that the prevalence of functional limitations in women receiving breast cancer treatment
      ranged from 18% to 54%. Functional limitations complicate the situation and bring the need
      for additional treatments to improve daily living activities, as well as the application of
      treatments related to the current disease to the patient.

      Exercise is one of the most commonly used modalities in the rehabilitation of patients
      receiving breast cancer treatment. The main goals of exercise in these patients are to
      increase muscle strength, reduce pain, increase limited range of motion and contribute to the
      ability to continue activities of daily living. Resistance exercises are the most commonly
      used method to provide strength gain and restoration, and there are many studies in the
      literature on their positive effects on strength enhancement in the affected extremity.

      The proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) technique applied for the treatment of
      the operated shoulder/arm may play a role in regaining strength, power and endurance by
      increasing the response of neuromuscular mechanisms by stimulating the proprioceptors. At the
      same time, there are studies showing that this treatment modality provides a significant
      reduction in shoulder-arm pain and provides painless quality movement. With this technique,
      functional restoration is provided thanks to the movement patterns applied in the diagonal
      direction. These gains reveal the importance of using the PNF technique more frequently in
      breast cancer patient groups where it is applicable.

      The PNF technique is emerging as a therapeutic option to increase muscle strength, reduce
      pain, and improve functionality in patients treated for breast cancer with ALND. The aim of
      this study is to compare the efficacy of resistance exercise and PNF technique, the
      effectiveness of which was defined on the patient, on the aforementioned subjects.Patients
      who applied to Istanbul Medipol University General Surgery Department for routine control
      after breast cancer treatment were determined. Individuals who were willing to participate
      and met the inclusion criteria were divided into 3 groups (PNF, progressive resistant ex.,
      control) using the website www.randomizer.org.

      Exercise was applied to both Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) and Progressive
      Resistance Exercise (PRE) groups, 2 days a week for 8 weeks. Each session lasted an average
      of 1 hour. Exercise sessions; It was carried out under the supervision of the same
      physiotherapist with experience in the field and individually with each patient. At the
      beginning and at the end of the treatment, warm-up-cooling exercises including mild
      stretching exercises to increase the range of motion were performed for 5-10 minutes. In both
      groups, exercises were performed only for the affected extremity.

      Preliminary evaluation of an obstacle alerting system to enhance the user's independent
      mobility by improving their confidence to drive and their safety in driving a powered
      wheelchair.

      Many powered wheelchair users find that collision free driving presents a significant
      challenge to confident and safe driving. In some cases so much so that the user will not
      drive their chair in some environments.

      Interviews with users in the EDUCAT project confirmed that users had problems driving safely
      and confidently in a confined space, passing through doorways or down narrow corridors and
      when reversing.

      Therefore the goal of this stage of the project is to improve the quality of life of the
      powered chair user by developing an obstacle alerting system which will help improve their
      confidence and safety in driving.

      This was to be achieved by asking expert users to provide feedback on the impact and
      usefulness of providing information about the presence and location of obstacles in the
      vicinity of their powered wheelchair.

      There are two aspects to this.

        1. User assessment of the usefulness of the obstacle alerting feedback. This will include
           user evaluation of the value of the different modes of feedback - audio, visual and
           haptic - and how best to adapt these to the range of driving environments and driving
           speeds. And what level of control the user requires to select and deselect these
           options.

        2. Monitoring the user's driving patterns with and without obstacle alerting -using the
           Stage 1 recording device.

      The analysis of this data, and feedback from the Users and carers will inform the development
      and design of the obstacle alerting system.

      Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the trial could not be carried out with powered wheel-chair
      users participating as they represented a clinically vulnerable part of the population. The
      trial was, therefore, adapted and carried out with adult non-wheelchair users.

      Second-line feeding strategies including hand expression and syringe feeding are used as an
      aid to breastfeeding, however little is known about their efficacy. This research explores
      the experiences of women who have used antenatal hand expression to identify how it affects
      maternal emotional health and breastfeeding continuation. UK women with recent experience of
      the practice were interviewed and the data analysed using thematic analysis. The results
      identified five themes in relation to these experiences including; The emotional distress of
      struggling with breastfeeding, Support as panacea but inconsistent, A crisis of confidence,
      Discord between knowledge, expectations and reality, and Syringe feeding as challenging but
      constructive. The study concludes that hand expression and syringe feeding supports women to
      establish breastfeeding, however, those struggling with breastfeeding need extra practical
      and emotional support to protect breastfeeding self-efficacy, emotional health and
      breastfeeding continuation. The findings highlight the importance of realistic, antenatal
      breastfeeding education to achieve this. Further research into second-line strategies and
      antenatal education programmes could contribute to the improvement of women's infant feeding
      experiences and improve UK breastfeeding rates.

      Objectives: The goal of this study is to understand whether self-knowledge, using the
      Enneagram, has a long-term impact as a modifying factor of the quality of life,
      self-compassion and compassion of medical students.

      Methods: An initial sample of 48 medical students answered, before, immediately after and 9
      months after an intervention, an online questionnaire with 6 scales. The intervention group
      took a self-knowledge and communication course based on the Enneagram. The control group was
      recruited by matching the sociodemographic variables with the intervention group. The data
      obtained was subject to descriptive and inferential statistical analysis and qualitative
      content analysis.

      Study design Longitudinal study of intervention, controlled, with a reassessment 9 months
      after the intervention.

      Selection of participants The process of recruiting participants involved an online
      dissemination of the study made by students from the Portuguese Faculties of Medicine of the
      Universities of Coimbra, Minho, Porto and Lisbon. Interested parties signed up on a Google
      Form, where the conditions of participation were detailed. The only defined inclusion
      criterion was to be a medical student enrolled in one of the several Portuguese medical
      schools.

      In order to understand the necessary sample size, the significant results obtained on the
      Burnout scale of a previous pilot study were used as a basis. The average and the standard
      deviation obtained before the course and the average achieved after the course of the 3
      dimensions of the Burnout scale were inserted into a necessary sample calculation formula,
      for an alpha of 0.05 and power (1-ß) of 80% (Sample Size Calculator:
      https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx.). We therefore set a target of at least 24
      participants needed to form the intervention group.

      Data collection Data collection was carried out by filling out a questionnaire on Google
      Forms lasting about 20 minutes. This collection took place in three stages: both intervention
      and control groups completed the questionnaire for the first time immediately before the
      beginning of the first session of the course (phase 1), having repeated it after the
      conclusion of the third module (phase 2) and again 9 months later (phase 3).

      The questionnaire was divided into two distinct parts: the first had the coding of each
      volunteer for later comparison of data, ensuring their confidentiality, which was followed by
      the collection of sociodemographic variables: gender, age, academic year and educational
      institution. The second part was intended to collect the variables of the measured dimensions
      (perceived quality of life, perceived stress, burnout, self-compassion, compassion and
      self-reflection and insight), through the application of 6 scales:

        1. Visual Analogue Scale for Perceived Quality of Life

        2. Perceived Stress Scale

        3. Maslach Burnout Scale for Portuguese students

        4. Self-Compassion Scale

        5. Compassion Scale

        6. Self-Reflection and Insight Scale- New Adapted and Validated Self-Awareness Measure for
           Brazilian Adults In the questionnaires of phases 2 and 3, a last open-response question
           was added so that the intervention group could share the benefits, in personal terms, in
           the management of stress and in the relationship and communication with others, which
           they thought they had acquired with the course.

      This randomized control trial examined the effects of postural education or corrective
      exercise intervention on the craniovertebral angle (CVA) in young adults with forward head
      posture (FHP). The objectives were 1: to investigate whether or not a corrective exercise
      program (CEP) consisting of self-myofascial release (SMR) + stretching; a CEP consisting of
      SMR + stretching + strengthening; or postural education (PE) had an effect on the CVA; 2. to
      determine which intervention yielded the greatest postural enhancement if a positive effect
      was observed in more than one intervention. *[note: SMR is a technique involving the
      self-application of pressure to fascia and muscle tissue for the purpose of enhancing
      flexibility, reducing muscle soreness, and influencing muscle relaxation]. It was
      hypothesized that 4 weeks after receiving either CEP intervention or PE there would be a
      significant change in the CVA compared to a control group; and that there would be an
      intervention more effective than the others for improving the CVA. The null hypotheses were:
      there would be no CVA change after intervention in any of the groups; and there will be no
      intervention more effective than another for improving the CVA.

      A total of 94 participants responded to invitations to voluntarily participate and completed
      the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+), followed by a questionnaire to rate
      their current stage of change (SOC) from the Transtheoretical Model adapted to assess
      exercise/postural modification behavior change (this will be discussed further in eligibility
      section). On this questionnaire, participants also responded to a yes/no question regarding
      if they have had a recent injury to their head, shoulders, or spine; or have ever been
      diagnosed with a pathology related to their cervical/thoracic spine or extremities, as part
      of exclusion criteria for the study. Participants then underwent a head posture screening
      performed by the primary investigator who is a licensed physical therapist in the Liberty
      University Biomechanics & Motion Analysis Laboratory with the use of photogrammetry (use of a
      digital camera and software to measure posture) as described below.

      Participants were asked to arrive at the lab wearing either a tank top or t-shirt, as well as
      to have their hair tied back if necessary. Height and weight were measured using a digital
      scale (Health-o-meter Professional, model 500KL, McCook, IL). Participants were instructed to
      sit comfortably on a stool with hands resting approximately two-thirds down their thighs with
      palms supinated and feet flat on the ground with hips and knees at 90 degrees; and to look
      straight ahead at an opposite wall in the laboratory. A digital camera (Canon Powershot,
      model SX540, Tokyo, Japan) was mounted and leveled on a tripod (Manfrotto, model 055,
      Cassola, IT) and placed three meters away from the subject. Two photographs were taken of
      participant's posture. Immediately after data capture, image files were uploaded into Kinovea
      video analysis software (version 8.15) for CVA assessment. CVA assessment will be discussed
      further in outcome measures section.

      Seventy-nine participants met inclusion criteria (discussed in detail in future section) and
      were enrolled in the study. Randomization of participant group assignments was completed by
      the PI using a block randomization generator. Utilizing a sequence created by the block
      randomizer, the PI placed participants who met inclusion criteria into one of four groups:
      postural education (PE; n = 20), self-myofascial release + stretching (SMRS; n = 20),
      self-myofascial release + stretching + strengthening (SMRSS; n = 19), and control group (CG;
      n = 20). Details of these groups will be provided in future sections. A hard-copy of the
      sequence generator report was kept concealed in a manila folder and was only opened by the PI
      during group delegation.

      Intervention duration was 4 weeks. Two weeks into the study, participants in intervention
      groups completed a mid-study questionnaire to assess intervention compliance. At the end of
      the study (after the completion of 4 weeks) participants in intervention groups completed a
      post-study questionnaire to assess intervention compliance. All study participants were asked
      to return back to the Biomechanics laboratory after the completion of the 4 week intervention
      period to undergo follow-up posture screening, which followed the same posture assessment
      procedures as described above.

      Much effort over the last several decades has been devoted to developing and implementing
      psychoeducational interventions for family caregiving partners for those with Alzheimer's and
      related dementias (ADRD). However, few interventions address the specific needs of care
      partners for those with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), the most common form of dementia
      in adults under age 60.

      Caring for a family member with FTD can affect the psychological, social, and relational
      health of families. Care partners for those with the disease have higher levels of burden and
      depression, as well as more sleep disturbances and worse financial strain than care partners
      for those with ADRD. Psychoeducational interventions can alleviate some of the psychological
      symptoms associated with dementia caregiving, but few programs have been designed for care
      partners for persons with FTD. Further, many of the existing programs are inaccessible for
      families due to distance and cost. The STELLA (Support via TEchnology: Living and Learning
      with Advancing dementia) intervention is designed to teach ADRD care partners strategies for
      managing behavioral symptoms associated with dementia. STELLA uses videoconferencing to
      connect care partners, in their own homes, with experienced Guides (e.g., nurses). The Guides
      use cognitive behavioral techniques to assist care partners in identifying and implementing
      strategies to reduce distressing behavioral symptoms in the person with dementia.

      Our pilot work found that early versions of STELLA reduced the frequency of behavioral
      symptoms and care partner reactivity to them. In this study, the investigators will adapt
      STELLA to specifically address the needs of family care partners for persons with
      frontotemporal degeneration. Aim 1. Adapt STELLA to the needs of care partners for those with
      FTD

        1. Gather FTD care partner feedback on STELLA and suggestions for tailoring STELLA for FTD

        2. Adapt STELLA for FTD care partners based on end-user feedback Aim 2. Assess the
           feasibility, acceptability and STELLA-FTD with FTD care partners Aim 3. Assess the
           preliminary efficacy of STELLA-FTD on the primary outcomes: reducing the frequency of
           behavioral symptoms and care partner reactivity to the symptoms as measured on the
           Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC).

      The goal of this study was to determine whether reading about others' experiences with
      suicide can help reduce suicidal thoughts. To investigate this issue, the investigators
      recruited users from an internet support community. The investigators randomized participants
      to two separate groups: a Treatment group and a Control group. Participants in the treatment
      group read one first-person narrative about suicide each day for 14 days, and answered
      questions before and after reading the narrative. Participants in the Control group answered
      questions once per day during the 14-day trial period and did not receive the narrative
      intervention until after the initial study ended. All participants completed a follow-up
      questionnaire two weeks after the end of the 14-day trial period.

      BACKGROUND In the US, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among all age groups, and
      the second leading cause of death of individuals 14 to 34. Despite the enormity of this
      public health concern, scientific progress has not led to lasting reductions in the suicide
      rate, which in 2019 was nearly identical to that in the US 100 years prior. Looking beyond
      the scope of traditional medicine and psychotherapy to identify novel treatments may be
      critical for improving our ability to ameliorate the problem of suicide.

      Scholars have discussed the act of reading as an effective treatment for psychiatric
      concerns, a concept within narrative therapy known as bibliotherapy, for centuries. Studies
      investigating the effectiveness of bibliotherapy have found that reading about others'
      experiences with struggles can be therapeutic. For example, bibliotherapy has been shown to
      improve hopefulness, reduce symptoms of anxiety, and reduce depressive symptoms. Only a small
      number of studies have examined narrative-based bibliotherapy as a therapeutic tool to help
      those struggling with suicidal thoughts, and of these sample sizes are small. However, one
      such study found that bibliotherapy significantly reduced the number of suicide attempts and
      nonsuicidal self-harm episodes among adolescents and adults who had recently received
      treatment for these behaviors. Another such study found that bibliotherapy conducted
      adjunctively with traditional psychotherapy for depressed adults significantly reduced
      suicidal ideation for three months following the intervention.

      Bibliotherapy has numerous practical benefits when compared with traditional psychotherapies.
      It is low-cost, brief, and can be conducted easily when face-to-face interventions are not
      plausible, such as during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The positive effects of
      bibliotherapy are also generally long-lasting, persisting for anywhere between 3 months and 3
      years. Further, bibliotherapy has been shown to be as effective as face-to-face psychotherapy
      for reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in one large systematic review. Finally,
      bibliotherapy is shown to normalize the experience of mental health struggles, thereby
      reducing stigma and allowing patients to feel that they are not alone. Due to the lack of
      large-scale randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of bibliotherapy, there
      may be additional unknown benefits to this practice, perhaps especially in easily-scalable,
      online peer-to-peer modalities, as with the present study.

      Three key aspects of suicide-related narrative bibliotherapy may be particularly beneficial
      to those struggling with suicidal thoughts. For one, the first-person perspective of
      narrative content conveys experiential knowledge about a subject area that is not often
      discussed openly. By sharing a first-hand experience with challenges, the author of the
      narrative can communicate specific challenges to be overcome, identify gaps in the reader's
      knowledge, propose strategies that were beneficial, and provide the reader with a plan for
      recovery. In doing so, suicide narratives, especially those that showcase recovery-related
      behaviors and activities (e.g., seeking support), could help people by illustrating the
      possibility of recovery. Indeed, inspiring optimism is shown to be a key benefit of
      narrative-sharing for individuals experiencing psychological distress.

      Second, suicide narratives may lead to improvements in mental health and wellbeing by
      increasing social connectedness to a broader community. This may be especially important for
      suicidal people who face stigma and social isolation that may further exacerbate distress.
      Moreover, improving connectedness may be critical in remediating problems associated with
      social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Third, narratives are implicitly engaging and naturally constructed to make sense of complex
      circumstances and emotions. Narrative-based bibliotherapy may therefore hold particular value
      in healthcare communications and in interventions for which patients are expected to learn
      and apply new knowledge, skills, or behavioral strategies. Likewise, bibliotherapy may be
      able to support patients' abilities to verbalize their thoughts and feelings by helping these
      individuals develop a semantic representation of complex psychological processes.

      Recently, a growing number of studies have revealed therapeutic benefits of digital mental
      health resources for people at risk for suicide. Such resources include peer-to-peer internet
      support networks, web-based individual psychotherapy platforms, and smartphone apps designed
      to improve the user's sense of self worth. The internet may be a fruitful domain for the
      development of new suicide interventions, as people with suicidal thoughts may be more likely
      to seek support online to avoid stigma, readily available methods for the detection of
      suicide-related discussions online have been validated, and digital interventions can reach a
      broader population more easily than traditional psychotherapies, including those unable or
      unwilling to attend in-person appointments. In short, society is in need of effective suicide
      interventions that are low-cost, engaging, and highly scalable, and internet-based resources
      seem poised to host such interventions.

      Social media platforms provide an opportunity for users to discuss their experiences with
      mental health difficulties and allow other users to read, comment on, and share these stories
      with others at no monetary cost. People with suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and related
      self-injurious concerns tend to utilize social media platforms as a way to communicate and
      find information about these concerns. The content posted on these platforms, therefore,
      represents an opportunity to explore whether this form of digital bibliotherapy can help
      people struggling with suicide. Several recent studies have provided preliminary evidence
      that digital bibliotherapies can be beneficial for suicidal thoughts. However, many of these
      studies are qualitative in nature, all examined small sample sizes, and none to our knowledge
      have employed a randomized controlled design to systematically examine the influence of
      narrative bibliotherapy on suicidal thoughts.

      In the present study, the investigators aimed to fill this gap in the field's knowledge by
      testing whether reading user-generated stories about suicide posted to a digital social media
      platform leads to a reduction in the suicidal thoughts of at-risk individuals. The
      investigators further aimed to test whether such stories are beneficial for people
      experiencing suicidal thoughts by helping these individuals feel more optimistic (less
      hopeless) and more connected to others (less isolated).

      PARTICIPANTS & RECRUITMENT

      Participants were recruited from the web platform, The Mighty, an online community dedicated
      to supporting those who face health challenges. Users of The Mighty can subscribe to content
      posted within sub-communities organized by specific challenges. Website moderators placed a
      ""popup"" advertisement for this study on pages that featured content about and related to
      suicide. Interested users, who had already established a user account with The Mighty,
      completed an online screening questionnaire that assessed age, race/ethnicity, history of
      suicidal thoughts, and current intent to act on suicidal thoughts. Participants qualified if
      they were age 18 or above, reported English as their primary language, thought about suicide
      in the past year, and reported current suicidal intent of six or lower on a 10-point scale.
      Eight hundred sixty-four participants met screening criteria and provided informed consent.
      Of this group, a final sample of 528 participants completed at least one survey including the
      main outcome of interest, desire to die, during the trial period. Participants were
      randomized into one of two study groups after providing informed consent, a Treatment
      condition and a Control condition.

      TRIAL PROCEDURES All trial procedures were approved by the Harvard University Institutional
      Review Board. Qualified participants received instructions about all study procedures by
      email prior to beginning the trial. Participants randomized to the Treatment condition
      received one email each day during a 14-day trial period. The email contained a link, which
      first asked participants to complete a three-item survey assessing self-reported feelings of
      (a) connectedness, (b) hopefulness, and (c) desire to die. Treatment condition participants
      were then instructed to read a single user-generated narrative about suicide, confirm the
      narrative was read, and finally complete the same three-item survey again. Participants in
      the Control condition received one email each day during the 14-day trial period that
      contained the three-item survey assessing connectedness, hopefulness, and desire to die only.
      Participants responded to all survey items using an 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1
      (""not at all"") to 10 (""definitely"").

      Two weeks after the conclusion of the 14-day trial period, participants in both the Treatment
      and Control conditions were asked to complete the three-item survey assessing connectedness,
      hopefulness, and desire to die. After completing the follow-up survey, participants in the
      Control condition received the same suicide narrative bibliotherapy intervention provided to
      those in the Treatment condition.

      The 14 narratives provided to participants in the Treatment condition each described
      first-hand experiences with suicidal thoughts and behaviors and highlighted a range of issues
      related to the authors' struggles. This set of 14 narratives was selected based on pilot
      research suggesting that they were associated with reductions in suicidal thoughts, included
      a positive conclusion (e.g., the author discussed recovery), and described the experience of
      struggle in a relatable way (e.g., ""feeling this way is common"").

      HYPOTHESES The authors tested four a priori hypotheses. First, the authors hypothesized that
      participants receiving the digital bibliotherapy intervention (treatment condition) would
      report lower desire to die over the course of the trial period than participants on the
      waitlist (control condition). Second, the authors hypothesized that the effect of the
      treatment would be maintained at the 2-week follow-up period. Third, the authors hypothesized
      that participants assigned to the treatment condition who completed more days of the trial
      would report lower desire to die (i.e., dose response effect). Fourth, the authors
      hypothesized that reductions in suicidal thoughts for participants who received the digital
      bibliotherapy intervention (treatment condition) would be mediated by increased perceptions
      of connectedness and increased feelings of optimism.

      It is known that tumors have an affinity for taking up amino acids from circulation or nearby
      tissues to use as a fuel source, to enhance their growth. Work in rodents has shown that when
      the levels of amino acids are reduced in diet, tumor growth is slowed and tumors are more
      susceptible to anti-cancer therapies. There are limited evidence-based dietary
      recommendations for cancer patients, which represents an urgent and unmet need. It is likely
      that reducing dietary protein will be beneficial, however this has not been tested. In
      advance of carrying out a study in cancer patients a study in healthy volunteers needs to be
      conducted to determine whether altering the amount of dietary protein, impacts the levels of
      amino acids (or other metabolites) in blood or the intestine. By demonstrating that altering
      dietary protein can alter the metabolome of healthy individuals, it will provide the
      information needed to reduce protein intake in cancer patients in future studies.

      After providing consent, subjects will undergo an indirect calorimetry test, which involves
      breathing through a disposable, single-use mouth piece into a machine that estimates calorie
      needs based on oxygen consumed and CO2 produced. Then subjects will be instructed on how to
      keep a 3-day food record and complete the Qualtrics survey designed for this purpose within 2
      weeks of consenting. Nutrient content of the participants' typical diet will be calculated,
      based on the 3-day and Qualtrics-based food/beverage log, using Food Processor software.
      Meals for the acclimation period will be created to mimic the participants' typical diet
      (daily calories and percent of calories from carbohydrate, protein and fat), as well as to
      meet their calorie needs per the indirect calorimeter test, for the first 7-9 days of the
      study. High protein diets (2g of protein/kg/day) will then be devised and provided for the
      next 14-16 days. Following this period, reduced protein diets (0.8g of protein/kg/day) will
      be devised and provided for the next 14-16 days. Fat content will be modulated to keep diets
      isocaloric while keeping carbohydrate content stable. Participants will choose between two
      3-day cycle menus for each feeding phase. Meals will be prepared in a metabolic kitchen
      housed in SBU's Business Incubator at Calverton. Meals will be prepared in batches, packaged
      and frozen at the incubator, then transported in a cooler with thermometers to the Food
      Service Department at SBU Hospital. Meals will be kept frozen in freezers until the day they
      are provided to participants. Logs of temperatures of coolers will be maintained daily, with
      temperatures checked every hour.

      In order to provide meals, participants will come to the feeding site to eat breakfast onsite
      and pick up other meals and snacks for the rest of the day. Participants will be provided a
      closed envelope containing a form that will list their participant ID# and age in which
      they'll sign in and indicate if they've begun any new medications or been diagnosed with a
      disease since starting the study. Additionally, twice per week, participants will be weighed
      using a digital scale in order to track changes in body weight while on the study. If weight
      changes greater than 2% of baseline, calorie content of the meals will be modified to avoid
      further weight changes. Food for the rest of the day will be provided in an insulated bag
      containing frozen cold packs and participants will be instructed to keep lunch and dinner in
      the insulated bag or a refrigerator until eaten. They will be instructed to heat the
      respective meals in a microwave until hot, prior to consumption. They will be instructed to
      take a picture of each meal before and after eating and upload the pictures via a
      Qualtrics-based survey, in order for the investigators to estimate how much food has been
      eaten at each meal. Although participants will be instructed to only eat the food and
      beverages provided for the study, they will log any consumption of food or beverages not
      provided for the study via this same Qualtrics-based survey. Consumption of water, black
      coffee and tea will not be logged.

      During days 7-9, 24-26 and 41-43 participants will provide a stool sample to be placed into a
      sterile container (provided by the study team) then placed into an opaque brown paper bag and
      provided to the study team. At the same time the stool sample is delivered, blood will be
      drawn to generate serum. If a participant provides samples in the earlier part of the

      The current study evaluated the Pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction (PK-DDI) of
      voriconazole with clarithromycin in healthy male volunteers. The drug interaction study was
      designed as a single oral dose, open-label, crossover, and randomized trial. In the first
      phase of the study, the principal investigator developed a high-performance-liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) method and validation according to standard ICH guidelines for the
      quantification of voriconazole in the biological matrix. During the second step, Enrolled
      volunteers were divided randomly into group A and group B by the ""permuted block
      randomization"" technique. Then, voriconazole either alone (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O) or in
      combination with clarithromycin (Voriconazole 2 x 200mg, tab + clarithromycin 500mg, tab,
      P/O) was administered to enrolled volunteers in two sequences. Finally, sample collection was
      carried out and blood samples were collected at specified time periods (i.e., 0.0 (pre-dose),
      0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12, and 24 hours) in EDTA or heparinized tubes
      from the enrolled human volunteers. Further processing of the sample was done for extractions
      and subsequent analysis with the developed analytical method.

      Study Design and Ethical Approval: The drug interaction study was designed as a single oral
      dose, open-label, randomized, cross-over study of healthy volunteers. The ethical approval of
      the protocol was taken from the Advanced Studies and Research Board (ASRB) of the Pharmacy
      department, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan before initiation. This study followed the
      ""ethical principles of the Helsinki declaration for medical research involving human
      subjects"" and ""good clinical practice guidelines"". The clinical trial of this study followed
      the guidelines of CONSORT. Written consent was obtained from all included volunteers in the
      DDI study. The study was comprised of two treatment sequences with a two-week washout period

      Randomization and Drug administration: Enrolled volunteers were divided randomly into Group A
      and Group B by the ""permuted block randomization"" technique. Computed the volunteer data into
      an excel sheet and applied a RAND* function; selected two groups (G-A and G-B) sized, finally
      assigned 6 participants in each study group for two (Voriz (alone) or Voriz + CLRM)
      intervention arms, for the execution of block randomization. A balance (1:1) was acquired
      across both intervention arms through this randomization technique. Treatment drugs were
      administered to enrolled volunteers in two sequences,

      Sequence-I: In the first phase, group-A volunteers on day-1 received oral voriconazole (2 x
      200mg, tab, P/O) while group-B volunteers received oral clarithromycin (500mg, tab, P/O)
      along with voriconazole (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O). A two-week wash-out period was allocated that
      started on day-2 to day-15 for avoiding the carry-over effect.

      Sequence-II: On day-16, the second phase of the trial was conducted in which group-A
      volunteers received voriconazole (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O) along with clarithromycin (500mg, tab,
      P/O) while group-B volunteers received Voriz (2 x 200mg, tab, P/O) only. Voriconazole and
      clarithromycin were administered to the overnight fasted volunteers corresponding to the
      sequences. All volunteers took the medication with a glass of water (250mL). On day-1 and 16
      (treatment days), standard breakfast and lunch were served two and six hours after drug
      administration to all volunteers, respectively.

      Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is accepted as the first treatment choice for
      most urinary stones. Still, it has adverse effects on the kidneys. The mechanism underlying
      the shock wave induced renal injury is not entirely understood, and oxidative stress has been
      speculated to be involved in this process. The Investigator evaluated the role of
      allopurinol, which works as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and free radical scavenger in renal
      protection against oxidative effects of ESWL. In a randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial, a total of 70 patients with renal stones undergoing ESWL were
      randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group 1 receive allopurinol, and group 2 receive a placebo.
      Allopurinol 300mg was given orally for a total of 3 days, beginning a day before ESWL. The
      urinary excretion of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and kidney injury molecule-1
      (KIM-1) were determined by quantitative double antibody sandwich direct ELISA at baseline
      before ESWL then repeatedly two h, and 24 h after ESWL. The resistive index (RI) change of
      the interlobar artery was asses along with the measurement of the shear wave velocity (SWV)
      in the focal zone of the treated kidney before, two weeks, and four weeks after ESWL.
      Multivariate analyses were performed using repeated measure ANOVA to control covariates.

      Subjects with kidney stones who met the criteria were given a detailed explanation about this
      study by the research team, then followed by signing the informed consent. History was taken
      along with physical examination, complete blood count, Bun, creatinine, uric acid, urinalysis
      and also anthropometric measurements (weight and height). Then each subjects got one of the
      intervention drugs, either allopurinol 300mg or placebo. Allopurinol 300 mg was finely
      grounded and put into gelatin capsules. The placebo was made by using Saccharum lactis
      material which was inserted into a gelatin capsule as well. The shape, color, texture, and
      weight of the placebo capsules were made the same as the drug allopurinol. Allopurinol
      capsules and placebo were made by the Pharmacy section of Sanglah Hospital.

      Subjects were randomly allocated using a permuted block method into the allopurinol or
      placebo group. Each subject received one type of capsule consisting of 3 capsules containing
      300 mg allopurinol or placebo taken the day before ESWL, 2 hours before ESWL, and the day
      after ESWL.

      The study was conducted double-blind where the researcher, subject, data collector, outcome
      adjudicator, and data analyst did not know the type of treatment. Medicines are given in
      sealed envelopes using an undisclosed code that will be uncovered at the end of the study.

      For the preparation of ESWL subjects; each subjects got infusion of 0.9% NaCl with 20 drops
      per minute, ondansetron 8 mg i.v., pethidine bolus 50 mg i.v., followed by drip pethidine 50
      mg and ketorolac 30 mg given in 500 ml NaCl 0.9% with 20 drops of 20 drops per minute.

      The Investigator performed ESWL using a Siemen litostar vario which uses an electromagnetic
      generator. The number of shock waves given is 2500-3000 shock waves per session. The given
      shock wave strength is slim to 2 J in the initial 200 shock wave followed by 3 to 3.5 J in
      the remainder of the shock wave. The given shock wave frequency is 60 x/minute.

      Urine samples were taken aseptically using the mid-portion method in the amount of 10 ml for
      examination of biomarkers KIM-1, NO, and MDA one hour before ESWL. Furthermore, the urine
      sample was taken 10 ml two hours after ESWL and one day after ESWL. Examination time after
      ESWL is calculated from the end of the ESWL session.

      RI examination and renal SWV elastography were performed one hour before ESWL, followed by
      two weeks and one month after ESWL by the same radiology specialist.

      Subject compliance with medication is evaluated based on the number of capsules taken from
      the entire drug administered. If the number of capsules taken is less, the subject will be
      excluded from the analysis. Adverse events or drug side effects are defined as unexpected
      events during the study, such as experiencing procedure-related complications or being
      allergic to allopurinol. The Investigator evaluated the subjects every week after ESWL to
      assess tolerance and possible side effects.

      If there was any drug side effects or serious adverse events(SAE), the subjects were reported
      to the ethics committee as soon as possible, less than 24 hours from the first time they were
      discovered, and actions were carried out as quickly as possible until the series of events
      ends. SAE was written in detail on the SAE form, including the following; when it was first
      discovered, the manifestation of the incident, the conditions before the incident, the
      handling of the event, and the outcome.

      If the subject experiences side effects such as allergic reactions (redness of the skin,
      swelling of the eyes or mouth) and severe gastrointestinal disturbances (vomiting, diarrhea),
      the subject will be excluded from the analysis. The subject will also be excluded from the
      analysis if they experience complications related to ESWL procedure such as ureteral
      obstruction, pain (VAS > 5), or there were signs of infection. Subjects will be evaluated
      when visiting the hospital according to schedule, telephone contact, or by making a home
      visit.

      The envelope of intervention data will be opened after data analysis, witnessed by an
      independent team, namely the Sanglah Hospital pharmacy and the Sanglah Hospital research
      division.

      Tooth loss is accompanied by different patterns of bone loss. Up to 50% loss of alveolar
      crestal bone width will likely occur 1 year after tooth loss, especially in the anterior
      maxilla. A great percentage of the process of alveolar bone resorption occurs within the
      first 3 to 6 months post-extraction. If ridge preservation is not conducted, 40%-60% of the
      total alveolar bone volume is lost during the first 2-3 years post-extraction, and this
      phenomenon has shown to continue to occur at a rate of 0.25%-0.5% loss per year. It has been
      proposed that ridge augmentation procedures may reduce the expected ridge reduction after
      tooth loss. Ridge augmentation procedures may require the use of bone grafts and
      non-resorbable or non-resorbable barrier membranes. The use of non-resorbable barrier
      membranes for ridge augmentation has the clinical disadvantage of needing a second procedure
      for its removal during the healing phase. Osteogen® plug (OPP) consists of a non-ceramic bone
      graft incorporated in type I bovine Achilles tendon collagen. OPP was first developed to
      serve as a one-step grafting solution for ridge preservation without the need for a barrier
      membrane

      There will be two(2) groups of standardized treatment (tooth extractions will not take place
      for research purposes. The Periodontal clinic receives referred tooth extraction indications
      for treatment as part of the patient's overall treatment plan) evaluated for this study.
      Subjects will be randomized to either treatment a) standard of care treatment for tooth
      extraction and ridge augmentation procedures with Cytoplast GRB, or b) standard of the care
      treatment protocol and ridge augmentation procedures with Osteogen.

      Each individual extraction site of the enrolled subject will be randomly assigned to Group A
      and/or Group B for the ridge augmentation procedure. It is possible for a subject to be
      randomized to both treatment groups. Randomization is like a ""coin toss"" prior to the
      initiation of the surgical procedure. The ""coin toss"" will be to define the procedure to be
      conducted for the smallest tooth number first. A computer-generated randomization assignment
      has been populated for the ridge augmentation assignments. The surgical procedure will be
      conducted following standard procedures for tooth exodontia and ridge preservation.The
      selected individual sites will be subjected to the standard of care extraction protocol and
      then randomized to one of two(2) ridge augmentation procedures. Intra-oral photographs will
      be made at the same optic focal distance using a ruler which will be used to evaluate areas
      where the membrane is still exposed and not epithelized. At 20 weeks postoperatively, each
      study subject will return for implant placement in the ridge preservation area. Excess tissue
      will be collected if the subject has a standard of care implant-related procedure where
      tissue could need to be removed for implant placement purposes. For example, if a patient
      undergoes a tooth extraction, ridge augmentation, and implant placement then any portion of
      the excised tooth and connective tissue will be kept for later analyses of histology
      discovery. No additional tissue will be collected for research purposes. There will be one
      screening visit, a treatment visit, and 7 post-operative follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
      8, and 20 weeks. Subjects will visit the clinic a total of eight (9) times. Of the 9 visits,
      1 visit is standard of care, 3 visits are a combined standard of care and research procedure
      visits and 5 are strictly for research purposes. The nonabsorbable membranes in the control
      will be removed after 4-6 weeks in a most atraumatic manner with the help of a tweezer
      without disturbing the underlying new connective tissue formation. As there is no need for

      locoregional anesthesia (LRA) and tourniquet in osteosynthesis of distal radius fractures

      the use of a limb tourniquet in such a procedure may cause less swelling and better surgical
      wound appearance in the immediate postoperative period, without compromising pain level,
      patient satisfaction, or improving the number of complications. In this regard, prospective
      randomized study was designed comparing short term results of patients who were operated
      using WALANT (A) to locoregional anesthesia (LRA) and tourniquet (B). Main outcomes were
      pain, swelling and patient satisfaction. Surgical wound bleeding,mobility, surgeon's

      Dental caries is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in people worldwide. Traditional
      clinical treatment of dental decay has developed on the basis of the removal of carious
      tissues with high-speed handpieces and slow-rotating instruments, inducing pain, disturbing
      sounds, and vibrations. In addition, this method comprises the tooth structure by removing
      both ""caries-affected dentin"" and ""caries-infected dentin"". The use of the chemo-mechanical
      caries removal (CMCR) method is one of the main implementations of the minimal intervention
      dentistry idea accepted in the last ten years. It includes the selective removal of
      ""caries-infected dentin"" while preserving the healthy ""caries-affected dentin"" that has the
      ability to remineralize. The CMCR method differs from the traditional surgical method in that
      it selectively removes carious dentin. Therefore, it is less destructive and less painful,
      thereby promoting a positive attitude towards visiting dentists. A novel agent for the CMCR
      method named ""BRIX3000®"" by the laboratory Brix Medical Science has been released onto the
      dental market in 2016. It is a papain-based gel derived from latex and fruits of green papaya
      (Carica Papaya) that works as a chemical debridement with a unique technology called
      Encapsulating Buffer Emulsion (EPE). Investigations are required to evaluate and compare the
      outcomes of two CMCR agents, ""BRIX3000®"" and ""Carie-CareTM,"" versus the traditional surgical
      methods. Therefore, the present study aims to perform a clinical and microbiological
      evaluation of caries removal using ""BRIX3000®"" and ""Carie-CareTM"" versus the traditional
      surgical methods in primary molars among children in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia.
    ","January 1, 2021",Actual,"[""Dental Caries""]","
      Dental caries is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in people worldwide. It results
      in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tooth tissues. The destruction of
      the dental structure does not occur as a result of a localized accumulation of bacteria, but
      rather as a result of an invasive and infectious process caused by the interaction of several
      interconnected factors. These factors make dental caries a great challenge for the dentist,
      as they seek an efficient means to control it. Carious dentin consists of two distinct
      layers: an outer ""caries-infected dentin"" and an inner ""caries-affected"". The
      ""caries-affected"" dentin is described as demineralized inter-tubular dentin, crystal
      deposition in dentinal tubules, and a lesser amount of destructed collagen matrix with no
      bacterial invasion. On the contrary, the ""caries-infected"" dentin displays deformation of the
      microstructure of the dentinal tubules and permanently damaged collagen fibers with
      significant penetration of the bacteria. Thus, the ""caries-infected"" dentin has to be removed
      only during caries removal. Traditional clinical treatment of dental decay has developed on
      the basis of the removal of carious tissues with high-speed handpieces and slow-rotating
      instruments, inducing pain, disturbing sounds, and vibrations. In addition, this method
      comprises the tooth structure by removing both ""caries-affected dentin"" and ""caries-infected
      dentin"". The concept of minimal intervention dentistry (e.g., air abrasion, laser,
      chemo-mechanical caries removal (CMCR) agents) includes the selective removal of
      caries-infected dentin while preserving the healthy caries-affected dentin that has the
      ability to remineralize. It is less destructive and less painful, thereby promoting a
      positive attitude towards visiting dentists among children. Brix Medical Science in 2016
      released a new CMCR agent named ""BRIX3000®"". It is an enzymatic gel for non-traumatic caries
      removal known with exclusive technology as ""Encapsulating Buffer Emulsion"" (EPE) that is
      claimed to have superior characteristics for caries removal compared to previous products
      available in the dental market. There are a few studies present in the literature, most of
      them published in non-English language versions, evaluating the clinical and laboratory
      properties of ""BRIX3000®"". Therefore, investigations were required to evaluate and compare
      the outcomes of ""BRIX3000®"" versus the previous CMCR agent, ""Carie-CareTM"" and the
      traditional surgical methods. This study was carried out at King Abdulaziz Dental University
      Hospital (KADUH) and the Microbiology Research Laboratory in the Faculty of Pharmacy, King
      Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to evaluate the efficacy, efficiency, and pain
      experienced by children with the use of the CMCR agents ""BRIX3000®"" and ""Carie-CareTM"" versus
      the traditional surgical method in primary molars. The study was approved by the ""Research
      Ethics committee"" at the Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) under approval
      number 107-06-19. Informed written consent will be signed by the parents/guardians of the
      children after explaining it to them. The study sample will be consisted of healthy and
      cooperative children aged 4 to 9 years old with bilateral open occlusal carious lesions in
      primary molars who will be seen as outpatients at KADUH's Department of Pediatric Dentistry
      from October 2019 to December 2020.The sample size was measured using G power analysis for
      calculating an estimated sample size. The final sample will be consisted of 60 children aged
      4-9 years with 30 pairs of matched contralateral open occlusal carious lesions in primary
      molars meeting the inclusion criteria. They will be randomly allocated to either group (1) or
      group (2). In group 1, 30 children with 60 primary molars will be subjected to caries removal
      by the CMCR method ""BRIX3000®"" (the experimental group) on one molar (n = 30) and the
      traditional surgical method (the control group) on the contralateral molar (n = 30). In group
      2, 30 children with 60 primary molars will be subjected to caries removal by the CMCR method
      ""Carie-CareTM"" (the experimental group) on one molar (n = 30) and the traditional surgical
      method (the control group) on the contralateral molar (n = 30). The block randomization
      method (a block of the two contralateral teeth) will be used to make sure that each side was
      treated evenly by both methods. The statistical assessment will be carried out using the
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, V.20, IBM, NY, USA). A significance level of

      It is more difficult to perform excellent professional oral hygiene in patients wearing
      orthodontic appliances.

      The hypothesis of the present randomized controlled trial is that the application of plaque
      disclosing agent allows better biofilm removal.

      To test this hypothesis, the patients, upon initial evaluation, will be divided in 2 study
      groups:

        -  CONTROL GROUP will receive professional oral hygiene without disclosing agent

        -  TEST GROUP will receive professional oral hygiene guided by plaque disclosing agent

      At the end of the professional oral hygiene session, the disclosing agent is re-applied in
      all patients and the percentage of residual plaque area is calculated though image software
      analysis (ImageJ).
    ","May 25, 2022",Actual,,"
      Oral biofilm is not always visible, so its complete removal can be challenging. Applying a
      plaque disclosing agent before the therapy might serve as a guide to better remove biofilm.
      Thanks to this tool, the clinicians can clearly see where the plaque is, so its removal can
      be more thorough.

      In orthodontic patients, it is even more difficult to remove biofilm and plaque, as the fixed
      appliances pose an obstacle. The hypothesis is that using a plaque disclosing agent as a
      guide to the operator, better removal of the biofilm can be achieved.

      The study will be performed to assess the efficacy of disclosing plaque agent as a guide to
      remove biofilm and plaque in orthodontic patients during professional oral hygiene, performed
      with air-polishing with erythritol powder and a ultrasonic device.

      TRIAL DESIGN: Monocetric, pragmatic, single blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of
      parallel design.The trial will have one-year duration.

      STUDY POPULATION: Orthodontic patients with plaque index above the 25% and without
      periodontal disease.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME: the percentage of area in which the disclosing plaque agent is present after
      the treatment (RPA: Residual Plaque Area).

      RPA: residual plaque area: percentage of area with residual plaque coloured by plaque
      disclosing agent. This will be analysed and calculated with a image analysis software

      Pain management is an essential component of every surgical procedure due to its effect on
      early mobilization. Adequate pain relief leads to rapid recovery and improved surgical
      outcome. It also decreases the chances of deep vein thrombosis, neuropathic pain and
      cardio-respiratory complications resulting in decreased cost and length of stay in the
      hospital. Poorly managed pain is not only inhuman but also detrimental for the patient's
      overall condition.

      Several narcotic and non-narcotic modalities have been used to achieve for adequate
      post-operative analgesia. Among these, opioid narcotics are widely used due to their potent
      analgesic effect. Unfortunately opioids have a number of unwanted side-effects including
      respiratory depression, chest rigidity, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. These unwanted
      side-effects had been shown to be decreased by the use of low-dose ketamine used immediately
      before wound closure in a number of surgeries. It has been reported that single dose of
      0.15-1 mg/kg ketamine along with opioids was effective in decreasing the post-operative
      narcotic consumption. Availability of narcotics is also an issue worldwide particularly in
      low income countries. Alternate drugs and methods have been tried to minimize opioid use. Low
      dose ketamine seems to be an effective adjunct in reducing opioid requirement during
      perioperative period. Subcutaneous and spray of low dose ketamine has also been tried
      successfully for tonsillectomy pain. The role of low dose ketamine in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not clear and is yet to be studied in our population. To
      analyze this effect a randomized controlled trial was performed to study the effect of
      low-dose ketamine on the narcotic consumption in PACU after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Materials and Methods:

      The Double Blind Randomized Controlled trial was carried out at the Department of
      Anaesthesia, Aga Khan University Hospital, after approval from the ethical review committee.
      Sample size was calculated to be 86 (43 in each arm receiving either ketamine or saline)
      using 80% power at 5% level of significance assuming a 30% difference in the mean narcotic
      consumption in the ketamine group as compared to the control group using NCSS~Pass (version,
      11.04).

      ASA I and II patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy between 25 to 60 years of age
      were randomly selected and informed consent was taken. Patients having psychological
      problems, seizures or any CNS disease, history of substance abuse, allergy to ketamine and
      pethidine, pregnancy, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal disease were excluded from the study.

      Intraoperative analgesia was standardized in all patients by giving 3μgm/kg fentanyl at
      induction. Syringes containing 10 ml ketamine or normal saline were prepared and documented.
      Patients were randomly allocated by sealed envelopes into two groups. Group S was given
      placebo (saline) while group K was given ketamine 0.5mg/kg intravenously just after the wound
      closure.

      Patient and the observer were blinded to the groups. Pain scores were documented in a
      proforma by using VAS as soon as patients were shifted to recovery room and repeated at 15
      and 30 minutes interval. Pethidine 10 mg was administered intravenously as rescue analgesia
      whenever pain score was ≥ 4. Total pethidine consumption in initial 30 minutes of recovery
      stay was calculated and documented.

      All patients were given supplemental oxygen in recovery room to prevent hypoxia. Tachycardia
      (heart rate ≥120bpm) and hypertension (SBP >140 mmHg) were managed by beta blockers.

      All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science version 19 (SPSS
      Inc, Chicago, IL). Continuous data are presented as mean and standard deviation after
      normality testing by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and histogram and analyzed by independent sample
      t-test. Categorical data are presented as frequency and percentage and analyzed by Chi-square
      test or fisher exact test. Effect of the intervention on amount of pethidine consumption was
      assessed by general liner model and regression coefficient were reported. To assess whether
      the effect of the intervention differed over time, an interaction between time and
      intervention was tested. Effect of the intervention on pain (measured 5 times during the
      first postoperative day) was assessed using a generalized estimating equation with continuous
      time, exchangeable working correlation matrix structure. Main effects were time and
      intervention. Interaction between time and intervention was also tested. p≤0.05 was

      Objective To study whether erotica by virtual reality (VR) during masturbation influences the
      quality of sperm donor ejaculates.

      Hypothesis Erotica by virtual reality improves ejaculate quality.
    ","November 25, 2021",Actual,,"
      The study design was within-subjects repeated measures, using balanced, randomized,
      controlled, cross-over sampling. Data was collected between 1 August and 25 November 2021 in
      the four largest cities in Denmark (Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, and Aalborg) from consenting
      sperm donors at Cryos International. A total of 63 'accepted' donors (aged 19 - 44 years old
      and with a BMI between 17 to 35) participated in the study.

      The VR setup involved a headset (Pico G2, Pico Interactive, San Fransisco, USA) offering a
      choice from 60 erotic videos each of 10-30 minutes duration. The men were allowed to watch
      any and as many of these video clips as they wished.

      Sperm samples were donated in private rooms dedicated for the purpose and equipped with a
      touch screen showing erotic material. The men were asked to donate as usual and self-report
      the amount of time (in hours) since their last ejaculation (the abstinence period). Every
      other donation, donors rolled dice to determine whether a VR headset would be used; with the
      subsequent donation performed with the opposite condition. To maximize privacy and minimize
      stress on the donors, the amount of time the donors took to produce a sperm sample (donation
      period) was recorded as the number of seconds from closing the door to the private room to
      when it was opened again.

      Each semen sample was weighed to determine ejaculate volume and allowed to liquify at room
      temperature for up to 1 hour. After liquefaction, aliquots were loaded in duplicate onto
      Makler counting chambers (Sefi-Medical, Israel) and observed at 200x magnification using an
      Olympus CX41 microscope (Olympus, Japan). Measurements of sperm concentration, motility and
      motile sperm concentration were made using a MICROPTIC, S.L. (Barcelona, Spain) Computer
      Assisted Sperm Analysis system with at least 500 cells counted per analysis. No analysis of
      sperm morphology was performed.

      The investigators used linear mixed models (LMMs) to assess the relationship between VR-use
      and ejaculate volume, donation period and total motile sperm count (TMSC) for each ejaculate
      sample, while controlling for several factors that might also influence ejaculates: (i)
      abstinence period, (ii) donor age, (iii) donor BMI, (iv) day of the year (season), and (v)
      location (donation site). In each model, the investigators included anonymized donor identity
      as a random effect to avoid pseudo-replication as each donor provided multiple samples. The
      interaction between VR-use and abstinence period was initially included in models as
      abstinence period is known to increase ejaculate size and quality, though sometimes a
      decrease has been observed. The investigators considered it to be at least plausible that the
      influence of VR might diminish as abstinence period increased and both ejaculate size and
      quality approached their maxima for each donor. The investigators removed those interaction
      terms from models when p-values for the interactions was >0.20.

      World Health Organization (WHO) Novel-19 Corrosion Disease (COVID) in 2019 without being used
      by a pathway caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. After the acute period in COVID-19 patients,
      muscle weakness may continue in breathing, weakness, and training. The primary muscle
      involved in calm breathing is the diaphragm. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts,
      increasing the thorax volume and lowering the intrathoracic pressure, thus allowing air to
      enter the alveoli with the negative pressure effect. Expiration occurs passively with the
      relaxation of the diaphragm. Although the diaphragm is primarily known as the respiratory
      muscle, it also plays core stabilization. The proper functioning of the spine and proximal
      extremity muscles is essential in daily life, and spinal stabilization must function
      correctly. The diaphragm transverses the abdominus, pelvic floor, and multifidus forces in
      core stabilization. Muscle weakness in the diaphragm can affect respiratory function and core
      stabilization.The investigators aim to examine the relationship between respiratory muscle
      strength and core stabilization after COVID-19. In the literature, although the relationship
      between respiratory muscle strength and core stabilization has been demonstrated in previous
      studies, no study has been found on healthy adults who exercise regularly after COVID-19
      infection. This relationship will be examined in this research, and the results will be
      presented. Thus, it is aimed that this study will guide the exercises to be added to the
      pulmonary rehabilitation programs after COVID-19 infection.The research will be implemented
      in Bezmialem Vakıf University Dragos Hospital Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Units.
      Among our target group, the exercises with and without COVID-19 are training between 18-50.

      No hypothesis (H0): Effects on core stabilization, respiratory functions, respiratory muscle
      strength, physical activity levels, and quality of life in healthy adults who do not have
      COVID-19 who do regular exercise, no difference compared to healthy adults who do regular
      exercise with COVID-19.

      Hypothesis (H1): The effects on core stabilization, respiratory functions, respiratory muscle
      strength, physical activity levels and quality of life in healthy adults who do not have
      COVID-19 who do regular exercise may be higher than in healthy adults who do regular exercise
      with COVID-19.

      The objective of this study was to conduct a pilot factorial randomized trial to identify the
      message frames that are most effective in promoting participation in a tobacco treatment
      trial for current smokers recently diagnosed with cancer. To do so, we used a multimethod
      approach to evaluate 3 different message frames across evaluation, effectiveness, and outcome
      measures. We combine findings from a message design experiment with textual analytic software
      to provide a holistic understanding of how message frames may or may not differentially
      affect tobacco treatment trial participation within the context of a cancer diagnosis.

      Background: A cancer diagnosis can catalyze motivation to quit smoking. Tobacco treatment
      trials offer cessation resources but have low accrual rates. Digital outreach may improve
      accrual, but knowledge of how best to recruit smokers with recent diagnoses is limited.

      Objective: This study aims to identify the message frames that were most effective in
      promoting intent to talk to a physician about participating in a tobacco treatment trial for
      smokers recently diagnosed with cancer.

      Methods: From February to April 2019, current smokers diagnosed within the past 24 months
      were recruited from a national web-based panel for a multimethod pilot randomized trial
      (N=99). Participants were randomized to a 2×3 plus control factorial design that tested 3
      unique message frames: proximal versus distal threats of smoking, costs of continued smoking
      versus benefits of quitting, and gains of participating versus losses of not participating in
      a tobacco treatment trial.

      The investigators aim to prove the feasibility of a non-invasive means to identify temporary
      neurological impairment resulting from the use of a commonly prescribed opioid by identifying
      an oculomotor biosignature associated with temporary neurologic impairment in pain-free
      opioid-naïve subjects, and to initiate the development of such a signature. The
      investigators also sought to establish the presence of a dose-dependent biosignature for
      opioid impairment.
    ","March 29, 2022",Actual,,"
      To determine the detrimental effects of opioid intoxication on normal oculomotor function,
      the investigators will collect data from up to 25 subjects before and during oxycodone
      induced intoxication. A within-subjects design will be used, and subjects will be tested
      under conditions of no dose (placebo), low dose, and high dose. Subjects will be tested
      during 3 sessions (baseline, placebo, oxycodone); separated by 7 days to allow for complete
      washout of any drug that was administered. Subjects will perform tests of visual fixation,
      saccade speed and saccade accuracy, cognitive control over saccades, cognitive control over
      visual scanning, and visual pursuit. Eye movement data will be collected using an SR Research
      EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracking system.

      Analysis of the data will be performed by comparing each subject state against the baseline
      measurements, where baseline represents an unimpaired subject state. Based on prior work with
      marijuana intoxication, the investigators expect that this data and analysis will
      successfully reveal a constellation of oculomotor dynamics that can be used to classify
      whether an individual is or is not currently impaired by oxycodone. Based on published
      studies, the investigators anticipate these changes will generalize across the opioid class,
      creating a biosignature of opioid impairment.

      advances in pharmacotherapy against COVID-19 have emerged.

      Regarding antiviral therapy, Casirivimab and imdevimab antibody combination is a type of new
      immunotherapy against COVID-19. Standard antiviral therapy against COVID-19 includes
      Remdesivir and Favipravir.

      Aim of Study:

        1. To compare the efficacy of antibodies cocktail (casirivimab and imdevimab), Remdesivir
           and Favipravir in reducing 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate,
           severe or critical COVID19

        2. To compare safety of antibodies cocktail (casirivimab and imdevimab), Remdesivir and
           Favipravir by monitoring hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions or other
           significant adverse effects

      Patients and Population:

      265 COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed patients with indication for antiviral
      therapy is included in this study and will be divided into 3 groups (1:2:2):

        1. Group A: REGN3048-3051(Antibodies cocktail (casirivimab and imdevimab))

        2. group B: Remdesivir

        3. group C: Favipravir

      Methods:

      Study design is single blind non-Randomized Controlled Trial (non-RCT). The drugs of the
      study are owned by Mansoura University Hospital (MUH), and prescribed by chest diseases
      lectures of faculty of medicine-Mansoura University. The duration of study is about 6 months

      mortality rate. COVID-19 infection has been classified as:

        1. Mild Illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19
           (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting,
           diarrhea, loss of taste and smell) but who do not have shortness of breath, dyspnea, or
           abnormal chest imaging.

        2. Moderate Illness: Individuals who show evidence of lower respiratory disease during
           clinical assessment or imaging and who have an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥94% on room air
           at sea level.

        3. Severe Illness: Individuals who have Saturation pressure of oxygen (SpO2) <94% on room
           air at sea level, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired
           oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mm Hg, respiratory frequency >30 breaths/min, or lung
           infiltrates >50%.

        4. Critical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or
           multiple organ dysfunctions.

      Covid-19 pandemic stimulates research works to find a solution to this crisis from starting
      2020 year up to now. With ending of 2021 year, various advances in pharmacotherapy against
      COVID-19 have emerged.

      1.2. Standard and controversial antivirals used in treatment of COVID-19 (Remdesivir and
      Favipravir)

      Regarding antiviral drugs used in treatment of COVID-19, Remdesivir is a standard antiviral
      against COVID-19 and has been approved by Food and drug administration (FDA) for treatment of
      mild, moderate, sever and critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other drugs have shown
      controversial antiviral activity include: favipravir, ivermectin, nitazoxanide,
      hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin. Favipravir became a standard antiviral which has been used for
      treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19 outpatients.

      1.3. Advances in immunotherapy for treatment of COVID-19

      Recently with the end of 2020, immunotherapy to target virus antigen has developed. Figure 1
      shows two types of immunotherapy include active and passive immunotherapy. Active
      immunotherapy is to enhance body to produce antibodies against virus as by vaccination.
      Passive immunotherapy involves direct administration of prepared antibodies acting
      specifically against virus or administration of product containing antibodies like plasma.

      There are three targets for these antibodies to work as antiviral including:

        1. antibodies that prevent the virus attachment and entry

        2. antibodies that inhibit the virus replication and transcription

        3. antibodies that hinder various steps of the immune system response Table 1 includes
           various types of antibodies under investigation for treatment of COVID-19 and their
           targets.

      1.4. Casirivimab and Imdevimab as antibodies cocktail against COVID-19

      In the present study, the point of research is antibodies cocktail including
      REGN3048-3051(casirivimab and imdevimab).REGN3048 and REGN3051 are human monoclonal
      antibodies targeting the spike glycoprotein on surface of viral particles thereby preventing
      viral entry into human cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptor, and
      have shown promising antiviral activity and need for further investigation to prove their
      benefit in COVID patients.

      Previous study on REGN3048-3051 has mentioned that both efficacy and safety of this
      antibodies cocktail are proved in COVID-19 outpatients treatment in both low (2.4 g of
      REGN-COV2), or high (8.0 g of REGN-COV2) dose when compared to placebo, Efficacy is measured
      as

        1. Virologic Efficacy Time-weighted average change from baseline in viral load through day
           7 (log10 scale) in patient.

        2. Clinical Efficacy Percentage of patients with one or more medically attended visits and
           Symptoms offset at day 7

      Safety is measured as Percentage of treated patients who experience infusion related and
      hypersensitivity reactions and incidence of any serious and unexpected adverse effect.

      This previous study concluded that efficacy is greater and more obvious in seronegative
      outpatients (whose immune response is not developed yet to produce antibodies against virus)
      and with high baseline viral load outpatients.

      Now, data is available for these new antibodies cocktails. The U.S. FDA has allowed an
      Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for casirivimab and imdevimab combination in the treatment
      and post-exposure prophylaxis of mild and moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric
      outpatients (more than12 years of age and not less than 40 kg) with positive PCR results of
      direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19
      requiring hospitalization or causing death..

      In contrast, REGN3048 and REGN3051 are still not authorized for use in patients:

        -  who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR

        -  who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR

        -  who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic
           oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity(FDA, 2021).

      Now, casirivimab and imdevimab are approved investigational antibodies, Serious and
      unexpected adverse effects can occur that not previously reported with their use.

      Confirmed adverse effects include hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions and the
      study have showed that there is no difference in safety profile between intravenous (I.V)
      infusion and subcutaneous (S.C) injection. Data about use during pregnancy and breastfeeding
      mother is insufficient yet. Also, Data not support any dosage adjustment in hepatic and renal
      patients.

      This antibody combination follows linear pharmacokinetics after its single intravenous doses
      with half-life of about 25 to 37 days for both antibodies. Regarding elimination, this
      combination is not metabolized by liver cytochrome enzymes ,and not excreted by kidneys.

      Limitations of the previous study performed on antibody cocktail include:

        1. short duration of follow up

        2. not used much clinical relevant outcomes like mortality rate

        3. Not studied the long term effect of antiviral efficacy in lowering viral load on
           inflammatory markers.

        4. Study performed on non-hospitalized patients only and not included hospitalized patients
           (trial is done only on outpatients and not inpatients)

      II. AIM OF THE STUDY:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of antibodies cocktail (casirivimab and imdevimab) compared to
           standard antiviral therapy in reducing 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients with
           moderate, severe or critical COVID19

        2. To evaluate safety of antibodies cocktail (casirivimab and imdevimab) compared to
           standard antiviral therapy by monitoring of hypersensitivity and infusion related
           reactions or other significant adverse effects

      III. PATIENTS AND POPULATION

      1. Background and Significance

           Trauma is the leading cause of death in the United States for people ages 1 to 44;
           uncontrolled bleeding is a leading cause of those deaths.1 Immediate hemorrhage control,
           even prior to the arrival of emergency medical services, can save lives during these
           emergencies. Since the launch of the Stop the Bleed (STB) campaign in 2015, the public
           has been empowered to stop life-threatening hemorrhage.2 One of STB's five objectives is
           to equip every bleeding control kit with audio and visual instructions; this has not yet
           been achieved. Commonly used tourniquets, such as the Combat Application Tourniquet
           (CAT) or Special Operations Forces Tourniquet (SOF-T), do not provide audio instructions
           and are not designed to provide feedback to facilitate tourniquet application. A device
           that could facilitate application and provide real-time instructions and feedback could
           be immensely beneficial to both the public and the DoD, especially to minimally or
           untrained people such as DoD civilians, contractors, and dependents on military
           installations. To achieve the above mentioned STB's objective, the research team at the
           National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health is devoted to develop a
           layperson tourniquet with audio-visual instructions and performance feedback.

           In January 2020, the research team conducted a pilot study to evaluate this novel
           layperson tourniquet in a community lay public sample recruited from at the NBC Health
           Expo in Washington, DC. Findings of this pilot study were promising. One highlight of
           the results was that the proportion of participants who applied the tourniquet correctly
           using the layperson tourniquet was significantly higher than that using the CAT (93.3%
           versus 6.3%). Moreover, for when asked about their favoritism toward the tourniquet,
           93.3% favored the novel layperson tourniquet, whereas 68.8% favored the CAT.

           In addition to research results, feedback provided by the participants in this pilot
           study allowed the research team and the manufacturing partner to make adjustments and
           improvements to the testing device. Now we have completed a pilot study evaluating
           overall user experience of the novel layperson tourniquet, our next step is to conduct a
           functionality study examining the function of this novel layperson tourniquet and to see
           if it performs on par with the CAT.

        2. Objectives/Specific Aims/Research Questions

           The objective of the study is to determine if the Layperson Audiovisual Assist
           Tourniquet (LAVA TQ)'s ability to occlude arterial blood flow is non-inferior to a
           Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT).

        3. Study Procedures

           This study will be a single blinded, randomized clinical trial. The study will be
           conducted in a room at USU's Multidisciplinary Laboratories.

           The study has two arms: SMART TQ is the experimental arm and CAT is the control arm. The
           study will consist of three groups of individuals:

             -  Medical professionals who apply the tourniquet (we will call this group ""medical
                professionals"" in this protocol).

             -  Volunteers who offer their legs for tourniquet application (we will call this group
                of individuals ""study participants"").

             -  Blinded observers who will use a Doppler to check and monitor pulse. Absence of the
                dorsalis pedis pulse will be used to indicate occlusion of blood flow. The pulse
                monitored by the blinded observers will be used as an outcome for this research
                study. The only person blinded in the study will be the person checking for a
                successful application by measuring the doppler pulse - that is the blinded
                observers. There will be a bedsheet, or similar screen, placed between the portion
                of the participant's leg that has the tourniquet applied and the participant's foot
                where the doppler pulse will be measured. In addition, the research team will
                provide blinded observers noise-canceling headphones to minimize the influence of
                audio instructions provided by the LAVA TQ.

           We will recruit two medical professionals and two blinded observers and consent
           volunteers (i.e., participants).

           Two medical professionals will attend a training session prior to the study. The session
           will allow the study team to verify that medical professionals can apply both types of
           tourniquets successfully. We anticipate this training session lasting no more than one
           hour and will recruit one participant for the training session.

           Upon the completion of the informed consent, participants will be assigned study ID
           numbers. The study steps are below:

             -  A study participant enters the study room, completing a demographic information
                sheet and taking blood pressure, and then lies down with the face and torso facing
                up.

             -  To capture the baseline dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse: A blinded observer uses a
                doppler ultrasound to check DP pulse, the artery pulse on the surface of the foot.
                Doppler ultrasound is a small medical ultrasound machine that uses high-frequency
                sound waves to measure the amount of blood flow through the arteries and veins. The
                doppler ultrasound probe will be placed on the exposed foot, a pulse detected, and
                the location where the pulse is detected on that foot will be marked with an ""X""
                using a surgical marker, and the doppler probed removed. This marked location will
                be where the doppler probe is placed later to determine whether there is a pulse.

             -  The research team member will measure the circumference of the leg at the area of
                tourniquet application. To keep the application location consistent across all the
                participants, we will mark where on the leg the tourniquet should be placed for
                each application.

             -  A medical professional records which leg will be used for tourniquet application
                (left leg or right leg).

             -  The medical professional applies the tourniquet. This is the first application of
                the tourniquet.

             -  Upon the completion of the tourniquet application, the blinded observer records the
                presence or absence of a dopplerable pulse. A blinded observer again uses a doppler
                ultrasound probe to check the dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse, the artery pulse on the
                surface of the foot, at the previously marked ""X"" location on the foot.

             -  The medical professional removes the tourniquet and the study participant takes a
                break.

             -  The medical professional places a blood pressure cuff first and then places a
                tourniquet over the blood pressure cuff. This is the second application of the
                tourniquet. The blood pressure cuff will be attached to a pressure sensor to
                measure surface pressure under the tourniquet. The medical professional will
                tighten the tourniquet until the doppler pulse is eliminated. The medical
                professional will then read and record the pressure readings.

             -  The medical professional removes the tourniquet.

           The procedures will then be repeated to a participant's other leg for the other arm. For
           example, if a participant is initially assigned to the CAT and uses the right leg for
           tourniquet application. The participant will then be in the LAVA TQ arm for the left
           leg.

           Termination Procedures: For the first tourniquet application on each leg, the observer
           will use doppler ultrasound to assess the participant's foot for a present or absent
           dorsalis pedis pulse. The observer will make the assessment at the location previously
           marked with a surgical marker. As soon as the pulse is determined to be present or
           absent, the observer will verbally tell the medical professional, ""remove the tourniquet
           now.""

           For the second tourniquet application on each leg, the medical professional will tighten
           the tourniquet on top of the neonatal blood pressure cuff as described. The study team
           member will record the pressure. As soon as the pressure is noted, the study team member
           will tell the medical professional, ""remove the tourniquet now.""

           Participant Post-Application Assessment: Following the application of two tourniquets to
           both legs, the study team will ask the participant to rest while lying on the table for
           five minutes. After five minutes, the study team member will ask the participant the
           following questions:

             -  Do you have any persistent pain beyond mild aching at the application site?

             -  Do you have numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations?

             -  Does your leg feel weak?

           If the answer is yes to any question, the team member will ask the participant to rest
           for five more minutes and re-ask the questions. If the answer to any question is still
           yes, the study team member will recommend that the participant seek medical care at an
           emergency department or with the participant's physician. If the study team member or
           participant is concerned that they are experiencing a medical emergency, they will call
           9-1-1 and alert any of the medical professionals assisting with the study for
           assistance.

           If the answer to the questions is no, the study team member will ask the participant to
           walk up and down the hall in the MDL. The study team member will observe the participant
           ambulating. If the person feels normal while walking, they can be discharged from the
           study.

           The study team member will be advised to follow-up with their physician or emergency
           department for medical care if either leg develops worsening pain, swelling, redness,
           coldness, or bluish or pale color, or if they have shortness of breath or chest pain.
           The study team member will advise the participant that some mild local bruising or
           redness in the area of the tourniquet application may occur and that it does not require
           medical evaluation.

           In addition, given the LAVA TQ is an abbreviated investigational device, we will follow
           the abbreviation requirements specified by the FDA.

        4. Data Collection

           The outcome variables in the study are: 1. the participants' resting blood pressure, 2.

           the presence or absence of dorsalis pedis pulse after tourniquet application, and 3. the
           surface pressure reading when the tourniquet is tightened. At the beginning of the
           study, participants will be asked to complete a demographic information sheet. On this
           sheet, they will fill out their age, gender, race, and ethnicity.

        5. Statistical Considerations

      The primary outcome variable for this research study binary (successfully stop the pulse:
      yes/no) and we conducted a power analysis for a parallel group non-inferiority trial.
      Assuming the two arms have the same high successful rate, with 80% power, and define the
      non-inferiority limit as 10% (so that a difference bigger than this would matter in
      practice), we estimated sample size required for each group is 13 applications (at least), so
      a total sample size of 26 applications (at least). Given the potential missing data and to
      ensure we will have enough statistical power for the final analyses, we will set the total
      sample size of 40 applications for this study. Since the tourniquet will be applied to
      participants' both legs (not at the same time), each leg will be one application and one
      participant will be able to fulfill two applications. As such, we will recruit no more than
      20 participants for the study session and one additional participant for the training
      session.

      This is a prospective randomized, open label, single center interventional study comparing
      the effectiveness of lithium versus carbimazole in lowering the thyroid hormone levels in
      patients undergoing radioactive iodine. Patients will be randomized into lithium or
      carbimazole arms in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will receive either lithium carbonate 300mg once
      daily or carbimazole 10mg once daily, which is the current standard therapy. The necessary
      precautions will be given with regards to the study drugs. Patients will be on the above
      treatment for a duration of 2 months and carbimazole will be stopped 3 days prior to
      radioactive iodine treatment whereas lithium will be discontinued on day 3 post RAI as per
      usual practice. RAI will be administered at a fixed dose of 15mCi in both groups.

      Antithyroid drug (ie. Methimazole or carbimazole) is restarted if needed (in symptomatic
      patients with FT4 of more than 40 pmol/L) at least a week after radioactive iodine and
      titrated as per standard treatment protocol. Patients are declared to be cured at the end of
      6 months based on thyroid function test and requirement of treatment either with thyroxine or
      antithyroid drug.

      Block randomization method will be utilised to randomize subjects into the two groups by
      selecting treatment arm from a box consisting of 8 options (4 lithium and 4 carbimazole).
      Once the box is empty, it will replenished by the same 8 options.

      Patients who are able to comply with the requirement of radioiodine therapy and consented to
      participate in this trial will be given appropriate counselling. These patients will be
      screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. A written informed consent will be obtained
      and patients will then be recruited into this study.

      Once recruited, history, physical examination including baseline eye examination for possible
      Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) will be carried out. TED as defined according to the presence of
      eye signs in categories 2-6 of the NOSPECS classification and determined clinical activity
      score of thyroid eye disease according to EUGOGO criteria. Patients will be then assessed for
      baseline thyroid function test (TFT), renal profile (RP) and liver function test (LFT) during
      screening. Patients will receive either lithium carbonate 300mg once daily or carbimazole
      10mg once daily, which is the current standard therapy. The necessary precautions will be
      given with regards to the study drugs. Patients will be enquired of any possible side effects
      during the clinic visits. Lithium levels will be checked at week 1 and at the end of 2 months
      of initiation (refer study flow chart). If patient develops intolerable side effects or the
      lithium level exceeded therapeutic range, the confounding drug will be stopped and patient
      will be managed accordingly. The patient will subsequently be withdrawn from the study. It is
      important to note that the lithium dose used in this study is of low dose, hence the side
      effects risks anticipated would be low. Current waiting period in PPUKM is about 2months.
      Patients will be on the above treatment for a duration of 2 months and carbimazole will be
      stopped 3 days prior to radioactive iodine treatment. RAI will be administered at a fixed
      dose of 15mCi in both groups. Bloods will be drawn for TFT, RP, LFT and lithium level on the
      RAI day. Lithium will be discontinued on day 3 post RAI. The timeline for stopping both the
      carbimazole and lithium are as per clinical practice guidelines. Patients will be followed up
      at months 1, 3 and 6 post RAI with TFT during each visit.

      All adult patients who are 18 years and above with hyperthyroidism either newly diagnosed or
      relapse disease secondary to Graves' Disease, toxic multinodular goitre and toxic adenoma who
      are planned for radioactive iodine therapy as a definitive treatment will be included in this

      This study was designed to investigate the effect of selected osteopathic manipulative
      techniques (OMT) on cardiovascular functions in healthy young men and women.

      This work addressed questions regarding physiological responses to OMT in maintaining the
      cardiovascular homeostasis by (1) measuring changes in the cardiac autonomic nerves activity,
      (2) measuring changes in cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure, cardiac
      contractility, and heart rate, and (3) investigating if changes in the cardiac autonomic
      nerves activity were related to changes in blood pressure, cardiac contractility, or heart
      rate.

      This controlled not-randomized pilot study with repeated measures was conducted at the Touro
      University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine. Healthy 21-35 years old students and
      employees volunteered in the study. The experimental group received the three cranial
      osteopathic manipulative techniques, occipital-atlantal decompression, occipital-mastoid
      decompression, and compression of the fourth ventricle, consecutively applied. This study
      included two control groups; one group received sham manipulations, and the second group did
      not receive any manipulations and was the non-touch group.

      The computerized MP150 BIOPAC System was used for data collection and analysis. The skin
      electrodes were used for the one-lead ECG and impedance cardiography. Digital data were
      recorded during the entire experimental protocol. The blood pressure was measured manually
      before and after the experimental procedure using blood pressure cuff and stethoscope.
      Cardiovascular responses to OMT were evaluated by using the heart rate variability test
      (HRV), calculating changes in cardiac contractility, and comparing changes in pre- and post-
      blood pressure readings.

      An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to evaluate
      treatment effects. The type I error rate (alpha) was set at 0.05.
    ","August 7, 2019",Actual,,"
      Healthy, 21-35 year old, male and female volunteers were recruited from Touro University
      students, faculty and staff using a brochure, poster, e-mail or personal conversation. Each
      participant signed an informed consent form. Participants were allowed to participate in
      multiple experiments (in the experimental and control groups) at least 7 days after the last
      experiment.

      Each subject's weight and height were measured before the procedure. Anthropometric measures
      were used in cardiac impedance analysis, and as descriptive statistics of the studied
      population. All cardiovascular parameters were recorded by using a non-invasive method. The
      disposable skin electrodes were used for impedance cardiography and a one-lead ECG.

      The subjects were lying in the supine position and were asked to relax. All surface
      electrodes were connected to the computerized MP150 BIOPAC System for data recording. The
      duration of experimental protocol was about 30 minutes, and included three intervals: 10
      minutes, pre-OMT rest phase (Rest); 8 to12 minutes (about 10 minutes) of the OMT/Sham
      (Manipulations); and 10 minutes post-OMT recovery phase (Recovery).

      OMT and sham manipulations were administered by an osteopathic physician. The participants
      were told to lie supine with physician seated at the side of the table facing the
      participant. Cranial OMT included three techniques and was administered in the following
      sequence: occipital-atlantal decompression, occipital-mastoid joint, and compression of the
      fourth ventricle. Control subjects received the sham manipulative procedure or relaxed in
      supine position (non-touch control). The total duration of OMT controlled by an osteopathic
      physician and was about 10 minutes.

      OMT and sham manipulations Occipital-atlantal decompression: Patient is in the supine
      position. The operator places the tip of a finger against the posterior tubercle of the atlas
      and holds that bone anteriorly, preventing it from moving posteriorly with the condyles as
      the patient nods or tips the head forward. This will release tension between the occipital
      condyles and the first cervical vertebrae.

      Occipital-mastoid joint decompression: The occipital squama is gently moved forward and
      upward (anteriorly and superiorly) with the pads of the long finger, and the mastoid process
      of the temporal bone is lifted anterolaterally with the pads of the index fingers. This
      technique decompresses the jugular foramen, which the vagus nerve passes through.

      Compression of the fourth ventricle: Manipulation is accomplished by having the operator's
      hands cupped to receive the lateral angles and supra-occiput on their thenar eminences.
      Gentle compression medially is maintained (generally 2 to 3 minutes) until tissue changes,
      such as a softening or increased motion, are noted in the supraoccipital area.

      Sham: The osteopathic physician placed his hands on the skull of the subject and did not
      influence cranial motion. The sham manipulative procedure (SMP) was administered for 10
      minutes.

      All manipulations were administered by the osteopathic physician; experiments were conducted
      at Touro University Nevada. Data were collected by a non-invasive method using BIOPAC
      Systems, Inc. Equipment MP150 for data acquisition and analysis. The protocol consisted of
      three phases: rest before manipulations (10 min), manipulations (OMT) (approximately 10 min),
      and recovery after manipulations (10 min).

      Data analysis Most cardiovascular response variables were measured at baseline, immediately
      after manipulation (""immediate response""), and at the end of protocol (""after rest""). The
      immediate responses and at the end of protocol were calculated on a percentage basis relative
      to baseline to control some individual variations.

      The percent response variables were each analyzed in a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
      which included time (""Immediate response"", ""after rest""), treatment (cranial manipulation,
      sham), and sex (male, female) as fixed effects. For significant interactions in the ANOVA, a
      Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to compare treatment effects within time, sex, or both. The
      type I error rate (alpha) was set at 0.05. The relationships among dependent variables were
      described with Spearman correlations between percent response variables within. Analyses were
      done in Rv3.5.1 (R Core Team 2018).

      To determine efficacy and safety of MONOBLUE DUAL View and MONOBLUE ILM View (study products)
      vital stains during vitrectomy surgery.

      Both study products are CE-marked and legally marketed in Europe. The data collection will
      serve as Post-Marketing Clinical Follow-up according MDR provisions. Retrospective data will
      also be collected for the two reference products: ILM Blue® (DORC) and Membrane Blue Dual®
      (DORC) to serve as control. For this purpose, patient data will be used that were collected
      in studies S61408 (Comparative study 23G vs 27G vitrectomy), S63610 (Comparative study 27G
      vitrectomy vs larger gauge surgery) and S64913 (EVA Nexus Field Observation Study).

      The expected effect of the study products is to provide the retinal surgeon with adequate aid
      in visualizing the membranes involved in the retinal pathology to treat, thanks to their
      staining capabilities.

      The performance of the study products is related to the visualization of retinal tissues (ILM
      and/or ERM) during the vitrectomy procedure, when these tissues cannot be distinguished
      accurately enough without staining. Their use allows for better identification of these
      tissues and facilitates their removal by the surgeon. The clinical benefit of using
      ophthalmic dyes is to increase the patient's ability to recover anatomically and functionally
      by allowing more precise surgery with an effective visualization tool.

      Along with collecting post-marketing clinical follow-up data on the subject products, the
      outcomes of the present study results may be used at the UZLeuven Hospital to decide to use
      Monoblue ILM View and/or Monoblue Dual View as standard-of-care, replacing Membrane Blue Dual

      Patients, who are getting a scheduled cesarean section and having no contraindication for
      valsalva manoeuvres are eligible for this study. The gestational week should be between 37
      and 42 weeks. Patients have to provide informed consent to this study. Patients must have
      epidural anaesthesia. They must understand the German language in order to understand
      information during cesarean section and correctly fill-out the questionnaires. Emergent
      cesarean sections or pregnant women known with chronic pain, severe preeclampsia or
      HELLP-Syndrome will be excluded.

      179 patients were initially recruited, of which 79 were excluded. The 100 patients were
      grouped into two study groups; Conventional and Assisted Groups. The grouping was performed
      randomly using simple randomization. Based on the findings of Armbrust et al and our clinical
      experience we expect a therapeutic effect of 20% which results in a mean visual analog scale
      reduction of 1.2. Applying a two-sided T-Test for independent samples at a significance level
      of 0.05, a mean difference of 0.8 between the groups and a standard deviation of 2, we need
      17 patients per treatment arm to detect a difference between both treatment groups with a
      power of 80%14. The number of patients per treatment arm was increased to 50 patients to make
      up for any missing data.

      The most important step in the treatment of TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disease in clinical
      dentistry is diagnosis and planning. The clinical findings, drug requirement and biological
      risk of the patients determine the examination methods to be used in the Treatment of
      Temporomandibular Joint Disorders. In this context, it is thought that studies in the field
      of dentistry should be increased in order to increase the success in the treatment of TMJ
      Disorders. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of of different pain relievers as
      Dexketoprofen Trometamol + Thiocolchicoside, dexketoprofen trometamol + paracetamol and

      Some undesirable complications such as pain, swelling, trismus, paresthesia, hematoma,
      infection and, albeit rare, fractures may occur after lower impacted wisdom tooth surgery.
      More effective wound closure methods with fewer complications have positive effects on
      postoperative recovery. Suturing is the most commonly used wound closure technique after
      lower impacted wisdom tooth surgery. Suturing, which is the last step of the operation,

      The aim was to observe the effect of the music integrated phonological awareness program on
      preschool cochlear implant users and to compare the phonological awareness skills of the
      study group with the control group before and after the online training.

      This study was designed to determine the benefit of music integrated phonological awareness
      programs for children using cochlear implants. In addition, the phonological skills and
      language skills of children using cochlear implants and children with normal hearing were
      compared in the pre and post-training results. Test of Early Language Development (TELD-3),
      The Phonological Awareness Scale of Early Childhood Period (PASECP), Mismatch Negativity
      (MMN) was used in this study.

      This study was carried out with follow-up patients in the Audiology, Language and Speech
      Disorders Clinic of xxx University - Medical Faculty, Department of Otorhinolaryngology. The
      study was performed with the approval of Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was
      obtained from all patient families (138955/ July 2021). There are 9 female and 14 male
      cochlear implant users in the study group; 9 female and 14 male children with normal hearing
      in the control group. Children ranging in age from 5 to 7 who also have 5-6 years old
      language skills without any neurological problems were included in the study. Cochlear
      implant mappings of all children were checked before the training.

      SPSS 25.0 (IBM) was used for statistical analysis. Pre and post-training comparisons of The
      Phonological Awareness Scale of Early Childhood Period, SMRT, and Mismatch Negativity tests
      were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test. The correlation of numerical measurements with each
      other was examined with Spearman Correlation. The differences in the numerical measurements
      used in the research according to the binary demographic categories were analyzed with the
      Mann-Whitney U test. The differences according to the multiple categories were analyzed using
      the Kruskal Wallis H test. The significance level (α=0,05) was used.
