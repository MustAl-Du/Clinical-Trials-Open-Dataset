      There is great concern on the tooth esthetics and color among people, especially young
      adults. Great efforts have been made in order to improve patients' smile. Epidemiological
      studies have reported that dissatisfaction with tooth color ranged from 19.6% to 65.9%,
      depending on different population. An oral health related quality of life questionnaire for
      use among young adults reported that tooth color was the most important concern. This
      dissatisfaction with tooth color has been shown to be associated with increased desire for
      treatments that improve dental aesthetics including tooth whitening dentifrices. Tooth
      whitening products generally help to improve the overall whiteness of teeth, by removing and
      controlling the formation of extrinsic stains. In recent years the interest on the treatment
      of tooth stain with various tooth whitening agents, among which dentifrice containing high
      cleaning silica is widely used.

      The primary PK parameter endpoint is AUC(0-∞) for bevacizumab. The secondary PK endpoints
      will include all other PK parameters for bevacizumab, including Cmax, tmax, t1/2, CL and
      AUClast.

      The serum PK parameters of bevacizumab will be calculated using standard noncompartmental
      methods. An analysis of covariance model will be used to analyse the log-transformed primary
      PK parameters (AUC[0-∞] and Cmax) and AUClast. The model will include a fixed effect for
      treatment and body weight as a covariate.

      All other PK parameters will not be subject to inferential statistical analysis.

      Estimates of geometric mean ratios together with the corresponding 90% confidence intervals
      (CI) will be derived for the comparisons of the PK parameters as follows:

      • MB02 versus EU Avastin®

      A mixed effects model with treatment arm as fixed effect will be used to compare
      natural-logarithmic transformed PK parameters (AUC[0-∞+, AUClast and Cmax) between the two
      treatment arms (MB02 vs EU-approved Avastin®)

      PK similarity between arms will be concluded if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
      geometric mean test/reference ratio of AUC(0-∞) fell within the predefined 0.80-1.25
      bioequivalence interval.

      All AEs will be listed and summarised using descriptive methodology. All observed or
      patient-reported AEs will be graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The incidence of AEs for each treatment will be
      presented by severity and by association with the study drugs as determined by the
      Investigator (or designee). Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
      Activities. All safety data will be listed and summarised as appropriate.

      Immunogenicity data (overall ADA incidence and titers, and neutralising ADA results) will be
      listed. A summary of the number and percent of subjects testing positive for ADA or
      neutralising antibodies before the dose of MB02, EU Avastin® (Day -1) and at scheduled
      post-dose assessments will be presented by treatment arm. All safety data and immunogenicity
      data summaries will be based on the safety analysis population. Select analyses may be
      repeated for subsets with or without ADA and de novo ADA formation as appropriate.

      The primary PK parameter endpoints are Cmax and AUC(0-∞) for bevacizumab. The secondary PK
      endpoints will include all other PK parameters for bevacizumab, including tmax, t1/2, CL and
      AUC(0-t).

      The serum PK parameters of bevacizumab will be calculated using standard noncompartmental
      methods. An analysis of covariance model will be used to analyse the log-transformed primary
      PK parameters (AUC[0 ∞] and Cmax) and AUC(0-t). The model will include a fixed effect for
      treatment and body weight as a covariate.

      All other PK parameters will not be subject to inferential statistical analysis.

      Estimates of geometric mean ratios together with the corresponding 90% confidence intervals
      (CI) will be derived for the comparisons of the PK parameters as follows:

        -  MB02 versus EU Avastin®

        -  MB02 versus US Avastin®

        -  EU Avastin® versus US Avastin®

      PK similarity will be achieved if the 90% CIs for the biosimilar-to-reference ratios of PK
      endpoints (AUC[0-∞] and Cmax) fall within the predefined 0.80-1.25 acceptance similarity
      criteria for all 3 pairwise comparisons; MB02 versus EU-approved Avastin®; MB02 versus
      US-licenced Avastin®; and EU-approved Avastin® versus US-licenced Avastin®.

      All AEs will be listed and summarised using descriptive methodology. All observed, or
      patient-reported AEs will be graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The incidence of AEs for each treatment will be
      presented by severity and by association with the study drugs as determined by the
      Investigator (or designee). Each AE will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
      Activities. All safety data will be listed and summarised as appropriate.

      Immunogenicity data (overall anti-drug antibody [ADA] incidence and titers, and neutralising
      ADA results) will be listed. A summary of the number and percent of subjects testing positive
      for ADA or neutralising antibodies (NAB) before the dose of MB02, EU Avastin®, or US Avastin®
      (Day -1) and at scheduled postdose assessments will be presented by treatment arm. All safety
      data and immunogenicity data summaries will be based on the safety analysis population.
      Select analyses may be repeated for subsets with or without ADA and de novo ADA formation as
      appropriate.

      There is a need to develop evidence-based interventions that rural food pantries can use to
      limit the distribution and intake of ultra-processed foods and promote the distribution and
      intake of minimally processed foods in the food environment and among low-income populations
      to promote better dietary quality and health outcomes. This research project, The UnProcessed
      Pantry Project (UP3): A Novel Approach to Improving Dietary Quality for Low-Income Adults
      Served by Rural Food Pantries, uses the Social-Ecological Model to target multiple levels,
      including the food supply in the rural study location (community level), the food environment
      at the food pantry (environmental level), and participant dietary intake (individual level).
      Aim 1 will adapt evidence-based strategies to inform UP3. UP3 will improve dietary quality by
      influencing the food supply through organization-wide nutrition policies, modifying the food
      environment with minimally processed foods and nudges, and changing participant dietary
      intake through experiential nutrition education. The UP3 pilot study will be conducted during
      Aim 2 with 40 participants served by two rural food pantries in Montana. The purpose of the
      pilot study is to investigate potential short-term effects on nutrient intake and dietary
      quality (primary outcome), assess acceptability of UP3 among participants, and evaluate
      feasibility in rural food pantry environments. It is hypothesized that UP3 will improve
      access to minimally processed foods and decrease access to ultra-processed foods at the food
      pantry, which will improve overall dietary quality of individuals as measured by the Healthy
      Eating Index-2015 compared to baseline and to the control group. Demographic and food
      security data will characterize the population. Psychosocial factors will be collected to
      understand changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about processed foods. Biomarkers
      of health data (i.e., weight, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, fasting lipid panel) will be
      collected to determine the feasibility of measuring potential short-term health effects
      alongside UP3. A control group of 20 participants at a rural food pantry will be used to
      assess dietary intake, psychosocial factors, height, and weight. Aim 3 will tailor UP3 for a
      scalable intervention suited for an R01 grant application to conduct a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT). UP3 is positioned to demonstrate the positive effects of limiting processed
      foods and increasing unprocessed and minimally processed foods on diets and, potentially,
      health among low-income populations. The short-term goals of this research are to develop an
      adaptable and scalable intervention suitable for rural food pantries serving low-income
      populations, as well as potentially contribute to a knowledge base around potential
      short-term effects of the minimally processed foods diet on dietary quality and health risks
      in those populations. The longer-term goals are to test the efficacy of the intervention in
      an RCT and then disseminate the approach to be integrated into rural food pantries serving
      low-income populations with the goal of decreasing health risks.

      Collaboration Live is a prospective, single-arm clinical study of subjects who provide
      written consent. Subjects are scanned using a Philips EPIQ 5 or EPIQ 7 Ultrasound System
      equipped with Collaboration Live software. The study investigator will evaluate performance
      of the Collaboration Live tool with regard to performance of conferencing, sharing and
      control capabilities. Adverse events will be reported and the study investigator will assess
      potential relationship to the study device or study procedure. Additionally, the utility of
      Collaboration Live in remote consult of study patients will be evaluated. No patient
      follow-up beyond the initial consultation will be conducted with the Collaboration Live
      software solution.

      Evaluation of the marginal bone and soft tissue alterations after the OsseoSpeed™ EV Profile
      implants placement in anterior maxilla.

      The following parameters will be tested:

        -  pink esthetic score - at the temporary crown delivery, at the final crown delivery, 6
           months post final crown delivery

        -  papilla index - at the temporary crown delivery, at the final crown delivery, 6 months
           post final crown delivery

        -  changes in radiographic marginal bone levels and width at buccal and palatal aspects:
           differences between baseline (the day of surgery) and 1-year post-op measurements on
           CBCT will be made.

      Surgical procedures

      Flap will be elevated following the crestal and releasing incisions (if necessary).

      After having completed the cleaning, the surgeon will perform the osteotomy. After the use of
      the final drill ᴓ3.2 the surgeon will take the measurement of the buccal and palatal/lingual
      walls height.

      If wall discrepancy is 1.5-2mm the site will be included in the study. Clinical photographs
      of probe within the osteotomy have to be taken. The osteotomy will be prepared with the
      conical drill, therefore the implant will be inserted in a special manner - lower part of the
      sloped collar will be located at the buccal aspect of the osteotomy preparation. At the
      buccal aspect the implant will positioned at the crestal bone level, while at the palatal
      aspect it will be either at the level of the bone crest or 0.5 mm below.

      The flap will be sutured with 5/0 or 6/0 non-absorbable Ethilon sutures using the mattress
      and single interrupted sutures. Clinical photographs of the treated site after flap suturing
      will be taken.

      Post-surgical instructions and follow-up

        -  Ibuprofen 400 mg 2-4 times per day will be prescribed in case of pain. In case of
           gastric problems it will be replaced by Paracetamol 1 g (max 4 g per day).

        -  Patient will be reminded to go on with the antibiotic prophylactic therapy as previously
           described.

        -  Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.12% for 1 minute twice a day for 3 weeks will be provided.

        -  Suture removal after 2 weeks.

      Check-ups and maintenance Appointments will be scheduled at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. Clinical
      photographs will be taken. During these appointments the presence of suppuration and flap
      dehiscence will be recorded dichotomously as presence/absence.

      Uncovering procedure will be scheduled at 8 weeks post-op. After crestal incision and gentle
      flap elevation the height of denudated buccal implant surface (if present) will be measured
      using a periodontal probe. Then the healing abutment will be screwed in and single
      interrupted sutures will be placed with the use 5/0 or 6/0 non-absorbable Ethilon sutures (if
      necessary). Suture removal is planned 7 days after procedure. Clinical photographs will be
      taken.

      Temporary crown will be delivered 3 months post implant placement. Clinical examination (PES,
      PI) will be performed. Photographs and control CBCT will be taken.

      Final prosthetic reconstruction will be delivered 6 months post-op. Clinical examination
      (PES, PI) will be performed as well as clinical photographs will be taken.

      1 year evaluation Clinical examination (PES, PI) will be performed. Clinical photographs of
      the study site will be taken. Control CBCT will be taken.

      In case of any complication observed during any of the scheduled visit or during an emergency
      visit, intraoral radiographs and clinical photographs will be taken and the CRF will be
      filled in.

      Myocardial infarction is a polygenic disease that may occur due to various environmental risk
      factors. Mortality risk of the disease; sex, age, smoking, systolic blood pressure, total
      cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein levels. The paraoxonase-1 phenotype is expressed as
      the paraoxonase/arylesterase ratio and is closely related to high-density lipoprotein, acting
      as an endogenous defense mechanism against vascular oxidative stress, thus contributing to
      the prevention of atherosclerosis. Serum concentration and activity depend on environmental
      factors as well as genetic polymorphism. This decrease in enzyme concentration causes changes
      in gene expression (1). Numerous data on Paraoxonase-1 levels have been found in studies,
      especially with decreasing serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities with age, associated
      with increased risk of systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in humans. Many studies
      have shown that serum Paraoxonase-1 activity is significantly reduced in people with
      myocardial infarction, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease. The most
      important risk factor for these and similar diseases is aging. Diversity of conditions such
      as genetic predisposition, malnutrition, stress, and smoking, which increases vascular
      dysfunction due to oxidative stress, classify individuals with acute myocardial infarction
      according to age groups and investigate whether there is a relationship between serum
      Paraoxonase-1 activity and severity of coronary artery disease in young patients. The
      paraoxonase-1 enzyme, which is known to decrease blood levels with age, is found to be
      significantly lower in patients with myocardial infarction at a young age compared to the
      healthy control group.

      High-density lipoprotein (HDL), known as good cholesterol, is named because of its protective
      effects on the cardiovascular system. in order to summarize the mechanism of the event,
      cholesterol is transported from the liver to the cells and from the cells back to the liver
      via blood. Cholesterol and other fats are carried in packets called lipoprotein to dissolve
      in the blood. Those with these are two kinds of cholesterol, these low-density lipoproteins
      and good cholesterol can help to lower the cholesterol as well. LDL cholesterol is the main
      package that carries cholesterol in the blood. When the blood is high, it sticks to the
      inside of the veins and forms plaques around here. With the addition of cholesterol, a blood
      clot that formed in cracks that occur on these plaques grow the arteries and clogs them. If
      the blockage occurs in the heart vessels, it can cause a heart attack and stroke. Cholesterol
      in the blood is a part of a package called HDL-cholesterol is carried in. HDL-cholesterol
      prevents the accumulation of cholesterol in the veins.

      It collects the cholesterol circulating in the blood and brings it to the liver to get rid of
      it from the body. Thus, it reduces the exposure of blood vessels to the harmful effects of
      cholesterol. All these effects of HDL cholesterol in the paraoxonase enzyme owes. This may be
      the reason why Dolat may even use another nomenclature instead of HDL in future years. A
      paraoxonase-1 enzyme, which is known to decrease blood level with age, is found to be
      significantly lower in patients with myocardial infarction at a young age compared with the
      healthy control group in this study, and the measurement of this enzyme level can be used as
      a screening test in people with risk factors.

      The utilization of arthroscopic surgery to treat meniscus injuries has continued to increase
      in recent years, partly due to a younger, more active population, and improved technology and
      technique. However, pain management in the post-operative period is critical to the ability
      to perform this procedure as an outpatient surgery. Traditionally, oral narcotic agents have
      been the preferred analgesic postoperatively in orthopaedic surgery. However, these agents
      are associated with several side effects, including nausea/vomiting, constipation, and
      somnolence. In addition, opioid agents have a significant potential for abuse in comparison
      to non-narcotic analgesics. In light of the rising opioid epidemic and nationwide initiatives
      to limit narcotic usage, surgeons must explore alternate pain modalities in the acute
      postoperative period. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.1 Multiple prior studies have examined the
      beneficial effect of oral and intravenous (IV) ketorolac as an analgesic in the postoperative
      period,1-3 including arthroscopic meniscus surgery. However, the beneficial effects of this
      agent following arthroscopic meniscus surgery have not been extensively described.

      1. The investigators aim to examine the use of IV and oral ketorolac as an adjunctive agent
           to the standard of care pain protocol for postoperative pain control following ACL
           reconstruction surgery.

        2. The investigators hypothesize that the use of IV and oral ketorolac in addition to the
           standard of care pain protocol will reduce postoperative opioid consumption following
           ACL reconstruction surgery.

      (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions

      clinical trial will test the feasibility of developing a smart-AAC system designed using
      individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique

      the proof-of-concept that a single surface electromyographic (sEMG) and inertial measurement
      unit (IMU) hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in information
      transfer rate (ITR) and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is
      optimized compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface for subjects with SPI.

      It is a randomized controlled clinical trial with non invasive topical intervention in 140
      adult patients of 18 to 60 years age, that will be selected randomly after screening and
      diagnosis of dentin hypersensitivity, in dental Out Patient Department of Periodontology.
      Written informed consent will be obtained. Participants will be allocated randomly into four
      equal study arms for parallel treatment assignment with dentifrices named BioMin F, Colgate
      Sensitive Pro-Relief Trade Mark,Sensodyne rapid action Trade Mark and Colgate Total Trade
      Mark dentifrices. Colgate total Trade Mark dentifrices does not claim pain relief in Dentin
      Hypersensitivity. Interim efficacy will be assessed immediately after topical application on
      sensitive teeth, in one minute, after 5 minutes, on day three and week 4 respectively. Dentin
      hypersensitivity will be tested with mechanical stimulus, evaporative air blast stimulus and
      water jet stimulus. It will be measured on Visual Analogue Scale and Schiff cold air

      This usability study is to test the basic functionality of the BrightArm Compact (BAC)
      system. The BAC is a motorized rehabilitation platform to offer gravity bearing for weak
      upper extremity. It has a medical grade PC which hosts numerous interactive, adaptable
      computer games, played using BrightBrainer Grasp (BBG) controllers. The device is passive, in
      that no actuators apply forces on the patient. Further, the patient is free to lift that arm,
      nothing restricts the arms movement away from the BAC table.

      Healthy, age matched participants are invited to test the BAC at Bright Cloud Int Corporate
      Labs (675 US Hwy 1 south, B203, North Brunswick, NJ 08902, USA).

      At the beginning of the usability training, participants will be required to sign a consent
      form, and BCI research staff will go over the details of the study and check inclusion
      criteria (generally healthy individual, age 50 ~ 85, English speaker, cognitively normal).

      Subjects participate in 4 study sessions over approximately 1 month, each session lasting
      about an hour. The BAC table will have a different configuration each session. In the first
      session the table will have 0 tilt (flat). In session 2 it will be tilted 10 degrees
      downwards, in session 3 the table will be tilted up 10 degrees and in Session 4 the BAC table
      will be tilted up 20 degrees.

      The difficulty of the games will also vary from session to session, progressing from the
      lowest difficulty in Session 1 to the highest difficulty in Session 4. Thus a given game will
      not be exactly the same, when played in a subsequent session, so to allow varying interaction
      scenarios.

      At the end of each session, participants will be asked to fill up a custom feedback form. The
      custom form has questions on the system, the rehabilitation table, the controller, the
      therapeutic games they tested, and their overall impression of the experimental device. Each
      question on the custom form is answered on a 5-point Liker Scale.

      At the end of the last session they will fill a standardized USE form, with questions rated
      on a 7-point Likert scale.

      Feedback from participant will be used to improve the device as well as the therapeutic
      games.

      Therapeutic treatment is yet available for declining memory, which is an impairment affecting
      the quality of life for many older adults and patients with cognitive impairment. Cognitive
      training with an immersive video game promises to drive hippocampal-cortical plasticity and
      associated gains that can restore memory capability or provide therapeutic treatment for
      memory deficits.
    ",,,,,,,,15-Dec-21,Actual,"[""Cognitive Dysfunction""]","
      A hallmark of higher cognition is the capability for flexible association of diverse bits of
      information stored in memory, such that experiences can be remembered in detailed and
      distinct terms (i.e., high-fidelity LTM). Interventions capable of sustaining improved
      learning and flexible association of new information into LTM remain elusive. Interventions
      have yet to be developed to attenuate the decline of high-fidelity LTM in normal aging or
      provide therapeutic treatment for patients with cognitive impairment without dementia (i.e.,
      MCI).

      This project applies a translational neuroscience approach in development of a cognitive
      training intervention that targets sustained improvement in capabilities for long-term memory
      (LTM) and cognitive control. Treatments use commercially available head-mounted display
      Virtual Reality (VR) technology and tablet computers to present a deeply immersive spatial
      wayfinding video game. Based on preliminary results, the hypothesis is that immersion in a
      game to navigate errands through unfamiliar, visually complex neighborhoods (i.e.,
      wayfinding) will be an effective means to environmental enrichment, which refers to a process
      whereby new and complex experiences bring change to brain and behavior.

      The significance of this platform is from the effects in brain and behavior arising from
      cognitive training, which can generalize to improvements in untrained capability for
      high-fidelity LTM. Research in rodents and humans shows that learning a new, enriched
      environment spurs the healthy function of the hippocampus and supports lifelong neurogenesis.
      Adult-borne hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked as the neurobiological basis for the
      formation of new, high-fidelity memories.

      The Labyrinth spatial wayfinding game was developed in-house to incorporate full scientific
      rigor, as with procedures in any properly controlled behavioral experiment. The game uses 3D
      and 2.5D computer graphics tools, as well as numerous levels of adaptive challenge, to
      deliver a dynamic, engaging experience for participants throughout the training regimen.
      Training can be administered with and without participant ambulation in movement through
      wayfinding runs.

      A participant's pre- and post-training assessments will occur promptly before and after their
      15 to 20-hour training regimen, including collection of functional MRI (fMRI) and structural
      MRI data. Cognitive outcome measures will assess capabilities for high-fidelity LTM
      retrieval.

      Effectiveness of the wayfinding game intervention will be evidenced by post-training
      improvements in retrieval of high-fidelity LTM and associated cognitive control capabilities.
      FMRI results associated with the measured cognitive improvements will localize changes in
      functional brain networks that support gains in memory capabilities. Structural MRI measures
      will assess morphometric and volumetric changes from pre- to post-training assessments.

      1 in 10 people in the UK cannot afford enough nutritious food to eat, to help them and their

      We aim to find out what it would be like for both dietitians and their clients to be asked,
      routinely in a dietetic appointment, about having enough food to eat. Your dietitian will ask
      you 2 questions about your access to food and, if you want, they will discuss some options
      which might be helpful for you if your access to food is limited. Some of the discussions
      that take place (regarding the intervention only) will be audio recorded with your consent to
      check they are being done correctly.

      If options which might be helpful for you to get more access to food were required you will
      then be asked to take part in a telephone interview, which will be audio recorded and will
      involve discussing your experience of the intervention and what you did with the information
      provided. After this telephone interview, this will be the end of the study for you.

      Background:

      Food insecurity is an international priority. This global issue is affecting developing and
      developed countries (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO 2018). 1 in 10 people within the UK are
      experiencing food insecurity (Taylor and Loopstra 2016). The prevalence of food insecurity is
      projected to increase due to continual cuts in the welfare state and introduction of
      universal credit. A study conducted by the United Nations looking at the food insecurity
      landscape in the UK identified 8.4million individuals (13%) were food insecure in 2014
      (Taylor and Loopstra 2016). In comparison to other European countries the UK has the 11th
      highest prevalence of food insecurity (10.1%) out of 28 European countries. Put simply food
      insecurity is not having physical access to enough nutritious food to eat well for good
      health. When food becomes scarce, hygiene, safety and nutrition are often ignored as people
      shift to less nutritious diets and consume more 'unsafe foods' (WHO 2018). The United States
      Department of Agriculture (2018) use the definition of food insecurity provided by Anderson
      (1990) 'the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or
      limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways'.

      Food insecurity can lead to negative health and wellbeing outcomes (Gunderson and Ziliak
      2015). For example, those children who are identified as food insecure are more likely to
      have asthma, behavioural problems and worse oral health. Mothers who are food insecure are
      twice as likely to report mental health problems. Diabetic adults who are food insecure are
      more likely to have poorer health outcomes due to the impact food insecurity can have on
      adherence to medical recommendations such as following a healthy diet for diabetes management
      (Gunderson and Ziliak 2015). New ways of tackling the increased socio-economic and health
      burden of food insecurity needs to be considered. Identifying and acting on food insecurity
      is fundamental for health professionals working in clinical practice.

      Dietitians are best placed to discuss food insecurity as their consultations are focused on
      diet, food and nutrition, however food insecurity is not routinely discussed or screened for
      in UK dietetic practice. Dietetic consultations in the UK are increasingly more holistic and
      brief interventions to make every contact count regarding smoking cessation and physical
      activity are being promoted. Making every contact count refers to the opportunity every
      health care professional has to raise health promoting issues irrespective of the reason for
      the consultation (Health Education England 2018). Commonly mood, physical activity, alcohol
      intake and smoking status can be raised in a consultation as part of the making every contact
      count initiative. The evidence around brief interventions being conducted by a variety of
      healthcare professionals, for several health behaviours, is growing (Lewis et al. 2013).
      These interventions use the 3 A's approach (ask, advise and act) and should only take a
      moment of a consultation time.

      In the US, Canada and Australia screening for food insecurity is already happening in some
      areas of clinical practice. The American Academy of Paediatrics released a policy statement
      in October 2015 that recommends all paediatricians screen all children for food insecurity.
      The policy statement identifies the short and long term adverse health impacts of food
      insecurity and recommends the referral to community resources (The American Academy of
      Paediatrics 2015). There is also emerging evidence in adult care that screening for food
      insecurity in diabetes and HIV care can have positive outcomes on treatment and now forms
      part of usual practice (Thomas et al. 2017 and Young et al. 2008).

      However, there is little investigation of screening for food insecurity in dietitian led
      clinics, and no trial to test this practice has been conducted in the UK. The evidence so far
      suggests that this is a feasible intervention to trial. We therefore propose to test the
      feasibility of a brief intervention for food insecurity in dietetic practice, by screening
      and referring on for food support using a food insecurity screening tool. The brief
      intervention will be based on the making every contact count initiative adopting an ask
      advise act concept. The brief intervention utilises 'social prescribing'.

      Aims and objectives

      Research aims

        -  To test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a Brief Intervention for Food
           Insecurity in Dietetic Practice

        -  To explore the experience of administering a Brief Intervention for Food Insecurity from
           a Dietitian and Dietitian service user perspective considering opportunities and
           barriers.

      Research objectives

        -  To complete a brief intervention for food insecurity in a dietitian clinic

        -  To complete an audio recording of some of the brief interventions to check for fidelity

        -  To monitor response rates for completion of the brief intervention in dietetic practice

        -  To complete a semi-structured interview with the dietitian service user to explore their
           experience (including barriers and opportunities) of the brief intervention for food
           insecurity via telephone

        -  To complete a focus group with the dietitians to explore their experience (including
           barriers and opportunities) of the brief intervention for food insecurity

      Methodology

      Study design

      Feasibility study with mixed methods design

      Intervention

      The brief intervention will screen for food insecurity by a dietitian asking 2 questions to
      the dietitian service user. A pre-developed 2 item validated screening tool that assesses for
      food insecurity will be used. It uses the first two questions from the 18 item U.S. Household
      Food Security Survey. The two-item screen was validated by Hager et al. (2010) who reported a
      sensitivity of 97% and specificity 83% for identifying an affirmative response for either
      question. The tool has been validated in U.S as a shorter more practical tool in clinical
      practice. This is what The American Academy of Paediatrics (2015) endorse.

      Once the dietitian has asked the two questions they will use the screening flow chart to
      advise why food security is important for good health and the clinical outcomes of their
      dietetic treatment, and then recommend what can be done to help act on food insecurity if
      present. To do this the dietitian will use two resources as appropriate (BDA Food Fact Sheet,
      Eat Well Spend Less and resource list for local food aid support). If trained, a referral
      voucher to a local foodbank will also be completed if appropriate. The dietitian will record
      the actions they take on the data collection tool.

      There may be cases where a dietetic service user is recruited to participate in the study,
      but the dietitian does not complete the intervention (the 2 screening questions). it is
      important that the dietetic service user is advised how to access these food aid support
      resources if the intervention is not completed as their expectations may be raised that they
      are going to receive this information and they are not fulfilled. The dietetic service user
      will be advised on the participant information sheet 'Should the dietitian at your
      appointment not ask you the questions about food insecurity but you would like resources
      about this, please ask the researcher in the waiting area or contact the lead researcher
      (contact details on page 3) for this information'.

      Training of the dietitian

      The dietitian will receive specific training prior to commencing the study as per the
      training protocol. The principal method of delivery will be a video tutorial, designed
      specifically for the study, which will be available to dietitians before and during the
      study. The video tutorial will be a filmed consultation which will assimilate the necessary
      skills and confidence required of the dietitian to successfully implement the intervention.
      The video tutorial will address the lack of knowledge and hence confidence to intervene on
      food insecurity. There will also be a suggested script to follow. Also included in the
      training protocol is useful information about food insecurity. If there is any uncertainty
      about the brief intervention delivery, then the dietitian will be able to contact the lead
      researcher for clarification.

      We need to consider the different learning styles of the dietitians. Some may learn better
      from reading the materials others may learn from discussing the materials with the lead
      researcher and others may learn better from observing the materials be delivered. Research
      suggests delivery of information from a blended learning approach is the best. The blended
      learning approach is hoped to overcome any concerns or queries the dietitian may have prior
      to delivering the intervention.

      Fidelity checking

      To examine the fidelity of the intervention, the brief intervention component of a proportion
      of consultations by each dietitian will be audio-recorded to ensure that the dietitian is
      correctly implementing the screening tool as per the training protocol (1 in 10 brief
      interventions will be audio recorded by each dietitian). Audio recording is less intrusive
      and more cost effective than implementing video recording or observations. The aim is to
      produce the least invasive way of checking fidelity. We also do not want to make the
      participant to feel uncomfortable.

      Population

      Dietitian service users attending NHS dietitian led clinics in the Coventry locality.

      Where possible we want to target the dietitian clinics that are ran in the most deprived
      areas of Coventry for example Foleshill and Hillfields. Coventry is the chosen setting for
      the intervention as this is where the first study for this PhD has taken place and Coventry
      has a good food aid support network for those in need. Coventry Foodbank is one of the
      largest foodbanks in England and is further developed than many UK foodbanks in relation to
      the additional services they provide. It has been identified as a pioneering foodbank centre
      that aims to educate, empower and advance the social circumstances of clients attending. This
      has arisen due to the high prevalence of poverty and food poverty in Coventry and the growing
      need for this community support service. Coventry is a marmot city.

      Sampling strategy

      Dietetic service user: purposive sampling, all dietitian service users attending dietitian
      clinic where the dietitian is trained to deliver the brief intervention will be invited to
      participate in the research

      Dietitian: purposive sampling, dietitians who undertake dietitian clinics will be invited to
      participate in the research

      Sample size

      A sample size has not been predicted as it is a feasibility study. The study needs enough
      time to test the process and ensure that food insecure individuals are attending clinic where
      the research is being tested.

      It is anticipated to recruit 5 dietitians and attend 10 of their clinics. Each clinic on
      average has 5 people in it and a 20% DNA rate. This exposes potentially 200 potential
      recruits to the study.

      Consent and recruitment of participants

      Dietitian service user

      All dietitian services users attending dietitian clinics where the brief intervention is
      being tested will be invited to participate in the research. Recruitment of the dietitian
      service user will take place in the dietitian waiting area whilst they are waiting for their
      appointment. The potential participants will first be approached by the researcher in which a
      verbal explanation and a copy of the participant information sheet will be given. The
      dietetic service user will be provided with adequate time to consider their participation in
      the study. They will have time to read the participant information sheet and will have the
      opportunity to ask any questions they may have, in order to decide whether they wish to
      participate in the study or not. If the dietitian service user is willing to participate in
      the study, they will keep the participant information sheet and sign the consent form.

      Dietitian

      Recruitment of the dietitian will take place at the dietitian main department. A member of
      the research team will be invited to attend a department meeting to recruit. The potential
      participants will be introduced to the research using the participation information sheet and
      a verbal explanation given by the researcher. The dietitian will be provided with adequate
      time (with up to 24 hours) to consider their participation in the study. They will have time
      to read the participant information sheet and will be given an opportunity to ask any
      questions they may have in order to decide whether they wish to participate in the study or
      not. If the dietitian is willing to participate in the study, they will keep the participant
      information sheet and sign the consent form. They will also be provided with information on
      how to access the necessary training to complete the brief intervention for food insecurity.

      Withdrawal

      The participant can withdraw at any time from the study without giving a reason(s) and
      without their medical care or rights being affected. Data collected up to the point of
      withdrawal can only be used after withdrawal if the participant has consented to this.

      As the dietetic service user will be asked two questions which may be considered sensitive,
      if the patient becomes distressed during the study they will be able to withdraw at any time,
      without giving a reason(s).

      Duration

      It is anticipated that the study period to gather all the necessary data will be 6 months.

      A semi structured interview will be completed with the dietitian service user via telephone
      and a face to face focus group will be completed with the dietitians to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability of the implementation of the brief intervention in clinical
      practice, exploring the opportunities and barriers.

      The semi structured interviews and focus group will be transcribed and then analysed using
      framework analysis. The data will be organised, analysed and coded using the qualitative
      software package, NVIVO 12.1 (QSR International Pty Ltd. 2018). The framework for analysis is
      a pre-constructed and validated coding frame called the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)
      (Atkins et al. 2017). Alongside the coding frame emergent coding will also be completed to
      'mop up' any aspects of the semi-structured interviews or focus group that may not have been
      captured by the coding framework. A sample of the coding completed by the lead researcher
      will be peer reviewed by a member of the research team. Member checking will be undertaken
      verbally by the researcher reflecting back at the time of the focus group or semi structured
      interview, to check what the researcher has understood is what the participant meant.

      The Theoretical Domains Framework was developed by a collaboration of behavioural scientists
      and implementation researchers to provide a comprehensive theory informed approach to
      identify determinants of behaviour. It was first developed in 2005 and then validated in
      2012. It allows people to assess implementation problems and support intervention design when
      implementing new practices that require changes in behaviour of relevant actors. The
      framework provides a theoretical basis for implementation studies (Atkins et al. 2017).

      Behavioural theories are relevant to investigating implementation problems and informing
      implementation interventions because they provide psychological processes hypothesised to
      regulate behaviour and behaviour change. The Theoretical Domains Framework synthesises 33
      theories of behaviour and behaviour change into 14 domains (originally 12). It provides an
      overview of the potential influences on behaviour - cognitive, affective, social and
      environmental. The framework is relevant to changing behaviours in both health professionals
      and patient behaviours (Atkins et al. 2017).

      Reflexivity will be considered by the lead researcher writing a reflexivity chapter. The lead
      researcher will also keep a reflexive researcher diary throughout the process.

      Publication and dissemination

      The results of this study may be summarised in published articles, reports and presentations.

      Funding

      There is no funding for this study. The study is being completed for a PhD programme.

      Sponsorship

      Coventry University is the sponsor for the study.

      Data protection and confidentiality

      The study will comply with the current data protection regulations and regular checks and
      monitoring will be undertaken.

      Storage of data on manual files will occur, they will be appropriately filed and stored
      securely. This is mainly referring to the essential documentation for the study.

      Confidentiality will be maintained by using a password protected university computer,
      anonymising all participants at the time of consent and storing manual files in a locked
      cupboard on an entry card protected site, to which only members of the research team will
      have access to. It is not anticipated that a portable laptop device will be required for this
      study. Contact details will be collected from the participants at the time of informed
      consent. The details will be anonymised and only available to the member of the research team
      who requires access.

      Audio recording devices will be required for the study (1 in 10 brief interventions will be
      audio recorded for fidelity checking, dietetic service user semi structured interviews via
      telephone will be audio recorded and the dietitian focus group will be audio recorded). A
      hand-held audio recording device will be used. At the end of each day the file will be
      transferred to a password protected computer and the file on the audio recorder will be
      deleted. This data will be filed and stored securely.

      Anonymity will be maintained when publishing the results. No information discussed is going
      to lead to individuals being identifiable. Member checking of data will be used.

      Ethical approval and research governance

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the ICH GCP (International
      Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceutical for
      Human Use, Good Clinical Practice) guidelines and in accordance with all applicable
      regulatory guidance, including, but not limited to, the UK Policy Framework for Health and
      Social Care Research. Ethical approval for this study will be sought from Coventry University
      Ethics Committee, the Research Ethics Committee (REC) combined with The Health Research
      Authority (HRA) approval. No study activities will commence until favourable ethical opinion
      and HRA approval has been obtained. Progress reports and a final report at the conclusion of
      the study will be submitted to the approving REC within the timelines defined by the
      committee.

      Conclusion

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a brief opportunistic intervention for
      food insecurity in dietetic practice in the UK. To the research team's knowledge, no studies
      have investigated this feasibility.

      If successful, trial results could make the case for brief interventions of food insecurity
      to be implemented as a simple treatment method in dietetic practice akin to the NHS stop
      smoking service as part of the MECC initiative.

      A study is proposed to test whether adding additional referees to youth soccer matches may
      reduce the risk of injury to the children playing soccer. Publicly-open youth soccer games
      will be randomly assigned to have either one or three referees and videotaped. The videotaped
      games will then be watched to record risk-taking behavior by players, referee decisions, and
      other factors relevant to potential injury.

      The mental health of new parents around the time of the birth of their baby has been
      identified as a key priority in the NHS (National Health Service) Long Term plan. At present,
      there is no nationally implemented method for monitoring parents' mental health, although the
      use of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) has been recommended. This is a paper
      based questionnaire administered by health visitors in the postnatal period. For the purposes
      of this project, the investigators contacted health visitors in Manchester to find out how
      they use EPDS in practice. Currently, health visitors only use the questionnaire if they feel
      there is a need during visits, and the questionnaire is not kept (only the overall score).
      Since almost 20% of mums develop postnatal depression, more systematic and thorough screening
      is needed.

      The investigators developed an app version of the EPDS which takes less than 2 minutes to
      complete on a smartphone. It is anticpated that this will be a more accessible and practical
      method of conducting this important assessment. This project is a feasibility study to find
      out whether an app would be a feasible, acceptable, valid and safe way to monitor perinatal
      mental health in women and their partners.

      The investigators aim to recruit 20 women and their partners in late pregnancy (after 36
      weeks gestation) and ask them to use the app. The app will prompt completion of the EPDS once
      per day until 6 weeks postnatally. Participants' responses on the app will be transferred to
      a secure server at the University of Manchester. Participants will be invited to complete a
      paper version of the EPDS at the beginning and end of the study to check validity. They will
      also be asked to complete a questionnaire measuring the acceptability of the app and to take
      part in a brief qualitative interview at the end of the study.

      This study is looking to address the effectiveness of three different intervention on hip
      range of motion. There will be a therapist performed mobilization group, a self mobilization
      group, and a dynamic stretching group. Participants will be recruited from the University of
      South Carolina and randomly assigned between the three groups to have equal distribution and
      limit any biases. Participants will come in on two different days in order to receive the
      intervention on the first and have hip range of motion measured on both days. The
      investigators will be assessing if there is any significant difference between the three
      groups.
    ",,,,,,,,6-Apr-20,Actual,,"
      The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of three clinical interventions intended to
      treat hip dysfunctions such as hip osteoarthritis. Physical therapists utilize mobilization
      with movement clinically to increase range of motion that has been limited by hip pathology.
      This study will compare mobilization with movement administered by a physical therapist,
      self-administered mobilization with movement, in which patients are instructed in the
      maneuver and then perform it at home, and dynamic stretching as instructed by a physical
      therapist. Efficacy will be judged through changes in hip internal rotation range of motion,
      a motion which is typically limited in patients with hip pathology.

      The objectives of the study are to quantify the effects of two different modalities of hip
      mobilization with movement and dynamic stretching in terms of hip internal rotation
      increases, and to inform current physical therapy practice by filling gaps in the literature
      surrounding the therapeutic effects of hip mobilization with movement. This study is intended
      to better equip physical therapists to select the most appropriate evidence-based
      interventions, thereby increasing the quality of patient care.

      Title: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for older adults experiencing psychological
      distress: A hermeneutic single case efficacy design (HSCED) series.

      Anxiety and depression in older age is associated with increased level of disability and
      lower quality of life (OAs). Unfortunately, pharmacological treatments are disproportionality
      relied upon to manage the mental health of OAs. Despite cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
      being the recommended psychotherapy, there is evidence that CBT is less effective for OAs
      than younger populations.

      An alternative treatment, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), has been shown to be
      effective in reducing distress for OAs experiencing physical health difficulties. Several
      case studies have also indicated that ACT can be effective for OAs with psychological
      difficulties. ACT aims to change how a person interacts with their thoughts/feelings; to
      reduce avoidance; and to promote value-focused living.

      The study aims to use an adjudicated HSCED to answer the following questions:

      i) Is ACT an effective intervention for older adult clients experiencing psychological
      distress.

      ii) Do meaningful changes occur for client-participants over the course of ACT intervention?

      iii) What specific factors (ACT-specific, non-specific, extra-therapeutic) contribute to
      observed changes?

      iv) Are observed changes broadly attributable to the ACT intervention?

      v) What adaptations may facilitate change when using ACT with older adult clients.

      For the study, up to four participants will be recruited from an OA community mental health
      team, each receiving up to 12 individual sessions of ACT. Participants will be required to
      complete a number of questionnaires throughout the study, including before/after sessions.
      Post-treatment, there will be a semi-structured 1:1 interview to explore any changes
      participants experienced, before a six-week follow-up is employed to check stability of
      change.

      This study aims to investigate whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an
      effective psychotherapeutic intervention for older adults experiencing psychological
      distress; what processes contribute towards psychological change; and what adaptations may be
      required to optimise ACT for older adults. There is currently an over-reliance on
      pharmacological treatments to manage older adult mental health (Andreescu & Reynolds, 2011),
      and a lack of inclusion of older adult in efficacy studies of psychological treatments (Gatz,
      2006). Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most evidence-based psychological treatment
      for mental health conditions. It emphasises the link between thoughts and feelings, and uses
      cognitive restructuring to facilitate improvement in psychological symptoms. However, of the
      studies that have included older adults, there is evidence that CBT has a lower effect size
      in older adults than with working age adults (Kishita & Laidlaw, 2017). There are a number of
      possible reasons for this, including a lack of age specific adaptations, the over focus on
      diagnosis specific treatment protocols in CBT, and the increasing physical and psychological
      co-morbidity associated ageing.

      ACT is a trans-diagnostic approach which aims to promote better living by supporting clients
      through six key processes (e.g. mindfulness, values). ACT does not aim to reduce distress,
      rather its goal is to promote better living or a better quality of life despite distress
      (Hayes, Strosahl & Wilson, 1999). ACT has been shown to have equal or superior efficacy to
      CBT with a number of psychological and physical health conditions (A-Tjak et al., 2015; Ruiz,
      2012). We propose that ACT would be especially suitable for older adult clients due to the
      high rate of co-morbidity older adults experience and the reduced ability to change aspects
      of these.

      However, there is a lack of understanding about the processes by which ACT works (Öst, 2014).
      Randomised controlled trails (RCTs) are the standard research methodology to investigate
      psychotherapy efficacy. Due to the stringent criteria required for RCT analyses, there is a
      limit to how transferrable the findings of an RCT can be to clinical populations (i.e.
      heterogenous groups). As such, a hermeneutic single case efficacy design (HSCED) is an ideal
      methodology to employ to identify what contributes towards change for each client. HSCED
      benefits from high ecological validity, whilst actively focusing on non-specific factors
      (components common to all psychotherapies, e.g., therapeutic alliance) and extra-therapeutic
      factors (components that are not related to the therapy, usually participant factors) to
      delineate change processes.

      The research proposal has been developed as part of a Doctoral Thesis in Clinical Psychology.
      This involved various research presentations panels and submission of an initial research
      protocol. These are designed to guide the decision-making process and gain feedback from the
      course research team. As part of the doctoral program, each trainee is allocated a Primary
      and Secondary Research Supervisor (both Clinical Psychologists), who aided in shaping the
      practicalities of this research proposal. Each project also recruits a Field Supervisor who
      supports with expertise in the project area. Participants will be recruited from the service
      the Field Supervisor is employed at, thereby creating a direct level of clinical supervision
      that is paramount to psychotherapy.

      Participants will be informed about the study through a member of their healthcare team. The
      service will ensure potential participants have the capacity to consent to treatment and will
      provide them with an overview of the study. Potential participants will be made aware of
      informed consent; that they do not have to take part and that declining to take part will in
      no way affect their treatment from the service. If a participant declines to take part at
      this stage, they will be offered treatment as usual from the service. If they consent to take
      part, the researcher will contact them the following week to answer any additional questions.
      This will allow them sufficient time to consider whether they would like to take part or not.

      This research aims to use a sample that is representative of older adults presenting with
      psychological distress. See Inclusion/Exclusion sections for further explanation of these
      criteria.

      This study aims to reflect usual clinical practice where possible; therefore, the burden to
      participants will be of a similar level to treatment as usual. That is, they will be expected
      to attend the older adults service for regular one-to-one psychotherapy and to discuss their
      mental health difficulties, contributing factors and what is maintaining their difficulties.
      Thus, as with any psychological therapy, there is a potential risk that talking about
      distressing experiences will cause an increase in frequency or intensity of pre-existing
      mental health conditions. These risks will be monitored through the study by the Trainee
      Clinical Psychologist (who is both researcher and therapist) through discussion with the
      participant, use of outcome measures and importantly by utilising weekly clinical supervision
      with the Clinical Psychologist at the service. This allows a space for any concerns to be
      raised and for the service to have clinical oversight of the participants.

      The aspects of the study which are additional to usual practice are as follows: participants
      will be required to complete more questionnaires; and participants will be required to come
      in for an interview after the block of therapy has ended. Every effort has been made to
      reduce the burden these place upon participants. For instance, shorter questionnaires have
      been used where possible. Participants will also be asked about any adaptations required to
      complete questionnaires (e.g. larger font, someone completing questionnaires with them).
      Participants will be reimbursed for the aspects of the study which are additional to usual
      practice.

      There are several potential benefits to participants taking part in this research, as
      suggested by the ACT literature. These include decreased psychological distress, increased
      psychological flexibility and improved quality of life.

      To ensure confidentiality, Participant Study Numbers (PSN) will be assigned to each
      participant to correspond with treatment data. PSNs will be listed in the Trial Recruitment
      Log along with participant's name, date of birth and NHS number. All other documents related
      to the participant will use the PSN only. All researchers will endeavour to protect the
      rights of the participants to privacy and will adhere to the Data Protection Act, 2018. Only
      the minimum required information for the purposes of the study will be collected. Participant
      information will be held securely, in a locked room, or locked cupboard or cabinet. Access to
      the information will be limited to the study staff and investigators. Computer held data
      including the study database will be held securely and password protected. All data will be
      stored on a secure dedicated web server. Access will be restricted by user identifiers and
      passwords (encrypted using a one-way encryption method). Information about the study in the
      participant's medical records / hospital notes will be treated confidentially in the same way
      as all other confidential medical information.

      As the main researcher is also the therapist, potential conflict of interests will be managed
      by: using weekly clinical supervision; fortnightly ACT supervision; a 20% random sampling of
      the audio recorded sessions to ensure adherence to ACT techniques; and using an independent
      researcher to carry out the Change Interview. Another benefit of using a HSCED series, is
      that an independent panel adjudicates on the final outcome as to where change was attributed
      for each client, reducing the researcher-therapist bias.

      Due to age-related effects, the bone and cardiovascular health are damaged. Physical exercise
      and in particular the strength training has been proposed as a fundamental tool to these
      pathologies, especially in the elderly. On the other hand, the use of normobaric hypoxia
      combined with exercise could have a beneficial synergistic effect on disease prevention and
      the quality of life of the elderly.

      Therefore, the general objective of this project is to analyze the effects of different
      methods of strength training combined with conditions of normobaric hypoxia on the bone and
      cardiovascular health of the elderly. This general objective is specified in the following
      specific objectives:

        -  To analyze the effects of circuit training with elastic bands on bone mineral density
           and bone remodelling markers of elderly, under normoxic and normobaric hypoxic
           conditions.

        -  To analyze the effects of circuit training with elastic bands on biochemical parameters,
           inflammatory, endothelial and clinical markers just like cardiovascular risk level of
           elderly, under normoxic and normobaric hypoxic conditions.

        -  To analyze the effects of circuit training with elastic bands on body composition and
           functional capacity of elderly, under normoxic and normobaric hypoxic conditions.

        -  To analyze the effects of whole-body vibration training on bone mineral density and bone
           remodelling markers of elderly, under normoxic and normobaric hypoxic conditions.

        -  To analyze the effects of whole-body vibration training on biochemical parameters,
           inflammatory, endothelial and clinical markers just like cardiovascular risk level of
           elderly, under normoxic and normobaric hypoxic conditions.

        -  To analyze the effects of whole-body vibration training on body composition and
           functional capacity of elderly, under normoxic and normobaric hypoxic conditions.

        -  To compare the effects of circuit training with elastic bands versus whole-body
           vibration training on bone and cardiovascular health of elderly, under normoxic and
           normobaric hypoxic conditions.

        -  To value the normobaric hypoxic environment efficacy on bone and cardiovascular health
           of elderly subjected to circuit training with elastic bands and whole-body vibration
           training.

      We hypothesize that bone and cardiovascular health will improve in the participants subjected
      to both resistance training, but greater improved may be found when these protocol are
      combined with normobaric hypoxia.

      Participants:

      Various associations of pensioners will be contacted as well as the university of seniors of
      the University of Extremadura to recruit volunteer participants. Total sample size will be
      120 people, being this calculated to obtaining a statistical power of 90%, calculated with a
      margin of error of 5% and a mean difference of 10% in the study variables Design All
      interventions will be performed during 24 weeks, with a frequency training of 3 days per
      weeks; sessions will be scheduled with at least one day of rest in between for optimal
      recovery. All patients were assessed at two time points: at baseline before intervention
      (Pre) and reassessed 7 days after the last session (Post). Participants will be instructed to
      continue with their normal daily activities, diet and caloric and calcium intake for the
      entire duration of the study.

      Interventions:

      During several times of the session in each intervention, oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be
      controlled using a finger pulse-oximeter (Konica Minolta, Japan) and heart rate (HR) using a
      heart rate monitor (Polar team 2, Polar, Finland) to know the physiological challenge posed
      on the participants during the exposure.

      PASSIVE HYPOXIA:

      During 30 minutes of session, the participants will be performed an intellectual activity
      while they will be exposed to normobaric hypoxic conditions in a hypoxic chamber (CAT 310,
      Lousiville, Colorado). They will inspire oxygen fraction (FiO2) set to 16.1% (0.16) in order
      to simulate an altitude of 2500m above sea level.

      NORMOXIA CIRCUIT TRAINING WITH ELASTIC BANDS Each training sessions will consist of a circuit
      training, where different muscle groups will be involved (pectoral, shoulders, back, arms,
      thighs, legs and abdominals). Duration of the session will be about 30 minutes, which will
      include 10 minutes warm-up consisting of slight movements, and 5 minutes of static stretching
      for the muscles at the end of the sessions. Main section of the sessions will be a circuit
      that will be composed by 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions of nine different exercises. Six
      exercises will be performed using elastic resistance bands (ERS; TheraBand®): chest press,
      row, glute kickbacks, front and side raises, standing bíceps curls and triceps kickbacks. To
      provide resistance with ERB, elastic bands with resistance ranging from light to very heavy
      loading (colors: yellow-gold) were used. ERBs were 2 meters, but the actual length used (grip
      on ERBs and distance to anchor point) was fine tuned for each subject in each exercise to
      find the correct resistance. When necessary to increase loading, two or more bands were
      combined. Bands were prestretched and never elongated more than 300% of resting length, as
      recommended by the manufacturer. Two additional exercise will be developed with kettlebell
      (KB): squat with 6 kg or increase loading until 10 kg; and hip trust, increase loading with
      support of a foot alone or with additional loading (KB of 5 or 10 kg). Finally, the subjects
      will keep a plank position during 15-20 seconds.

      Training will take place in a hypoxia chamber (CAT 310, Lousiville, Colorado, United States)
      will place in the laboratory. In order to blind subjects to altitude, the system will be run
      with normoxic airflow into the chamber (up to 1000 l/min) and will produce the same audible
      noise as in the hypoxic condition. Subjects will inspire FiO2 of 21.0% (0.21) to simulate an
      altitude of 459 m above sea level. Furthermore, all systems will be covered with fabric to
      prevent participants from visually identifying the normoxic or hypoxic conditions. FiO2 will
      be controlled regularly with an electronic device (HANDIC,Maxtec, Salt Lake City, Utah,
      United States).

      HYPOXIA CIRCUIT TRAINING WITH ELASTIC BANDS Each training sessions will consist of a circuit
      training, where different muscle groups will be involved (pectoral, shoulders, back, arms,
      thighs, legs and abdominals). Duration of the session will be about 30 minutes, which will
      include 10 minutes warm-up consisting of slight movements, and 5 minutes of static stretching
      for the muscles at the end of the sessions. Main section of the sessions will be a circuit,
      that will be composed by 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions of nine different exercises. Six
      exercises will be performed using elastic resistance bands (ERS; TheraBand®): chest press,
      row, glute kickbacks, front and side raises, standing bíceps curls and triceps kickbacks. To
      provide resistance with ERB, elastic bands with resistance ranging from light to very heavy
      loading (colors: yellow-gold) were used. ERBs were 2 meters, but the actual length used (grip
      on ERBs and distance to anchor point) was fine tuned for each subject in each exercise to
      find the correct resistance. When necessary to increase loading, two or more bands were
      combined. Bands were prestretched and never elongated more than 300% of resting length, as
      recommended by the manufacturer. Two additional exercise will be developed with kettlebell
      (KB): squat with 6 kg or increase loading until 10 kg; and hip trust, increase loading with
      support of a foot alone or with additional loading (KB of 5 or 10 kg). Finally, the subjects
      will keep a plank position during 15-20 seconds Training will take place in a hypoxia chamber
      (CAT 310, Lousiville, Colorado, United States) will place in the laboratory. Participants
      will inspire a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 16.1% (0.16) to simulate an altitude of
      2500 m above sea level; FiO2 will be controlled regularly with an electronic device
      (HANDIC,Maxtec, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States).

      NORMOXIA WHOLE-BODY VIBRATION The subjects will perform dynamic and static vibration exercise
      provide by a commercially available device (Galileo 2000, Novotec GmbH, Pforzheim, Alemania).
      The duration of the WBV session will be about 30 minutes, which will include 10 minutes
      warm-up consisting of slight movements, and 5 minutes of static stretching for the muscles at
      the end of the session.

      Repetitions of 30 seconds with a frequency of 18.5 Hz will be performed. The rest interval
      will be 60 seconds between 4 repetitions during weeks 1-12 and 45 seconds between 5
      repetitions during weeks 12-24. The vertical amplitude of WBV was set at 2.5 mm. Four stance
      will be performance, with the soles of both feet remained in contact with the platform:

        1. Stand with feet side-by-side on the board, which produced lateral oscillations of the
           whole body. During the vibration training sessions, the subjects will be barefoot to
           eliminate any damping of the vibration caused by footwear. The angle of flexion of the
           knees during the vibration exercise will be set at 60°.

        2. Begin with the feet placed perpendicular to the midline axis of the platform, with a
           foot positioned slightly ahead of the other foot. Lift the toes of the one foot and the
           heel of the other foot 4 mm above the surface of the platform. Bend the knees and
           maintain a 45°knee angle. Keep the back and head straight. Alternate legs.

        3. Front foot 4 mm above the surface of the platform and back foot on ground, front knee
           angle 90°. Alternate legs

        4. Lay down on the ground, with the knees bent and feet flat on the platform. Keep the arms
           at your side with your palms down. Lift the hips off the ground until the knees, hips
           and shoulders form a straight line. Hold your bridged position.

      Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using the statistical analysis
      package SPSS v.20 (IBM, New York, United States). Data will be expressed as median and
      standard deviation. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests will be conducted to show the distribution of
      the studied variables and Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Repeated measure ANOVA
      will be used to compare the response of each variable, considering the sex and age as
      covariate. The p < 0.05 criterion was used for establishing statistical significance. Effect
      size (Cohen, 1992) will be also calculated for all variables, considering the magnitude of
      change as small (0.2), moderate (0.5) or large (0.8).

      An SpO2 accuracy comparison was conducted as part of the final validation of the VitalDetect™
      pulse oximetry system. The study was conducted in accordance to Code of Federal Regulations
      (CFR) for Non-Significant Risk (NSR) investigational studies, following International
      Standards Organization (ISO) 14155:2011 as appropriate and the pulse oximetry guidelines of
      ISO 80601-2-61:2017 applicable sections, and Pulse Oximeters - Premarket Notifications
      Submissions [510(k)s] Guidance For Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (issued:
      March 4, 2013).

      The purpose of this study was to validate the SpO2 accuracy of the VitalDetect™ pulse
      oximetry system during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 as compared to
      arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry. It was expected that the Accuracy Root Mean
      Square (ARMS) performance of the oximetry system would meet the required specification of
      ARMS of 3.0% or less.

      A secondary goal was to evaluate the pulse rate performance simultaneously collected over the
      SpO2 range covered. The Pulse Rate Accuracy Root Mean Square (Arms) performance of the
      VitalDetect™ pulse oximetry system, were expected to meet a specification of 3 bpm.

      The myHealth Rewards wellness program managed by GHP rewards those GHP members who carry
      their insurance through employment at Geisinger with reduced health insurance premiums over
      the course of the following year, if members register for the program and have their health
      measures on file by the enrollment deadline and are then able to meet their health goals by
      the respective due date. In spite of the potential savings to health plan members and the
      wellness program's potential to motivate engagement in healthy activities (with consequent
      improvement in health outcomes), about 23% of eligible existing GHP members did not enroll
      during the primary 2019 enrollment period, even after receiving promotional email
      communications and reminders.

      Previous work examining myHealth Rewards found that email communication using loss framing
      language achieved significantly higher click-through rates than a more standard
      communication, whereas actual enrollment rates were not statistically significantly higher.

      The current study aims to analyze de-identified Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) member data,
      comparing enrollment status (and secondarily, click-through rates) within the 2020 enrollment
      period across email conditions to which GHP members will be randomly assigned. The main part
      of this study will compare the effects of a standard, generic communication vs. communication
      with loss framing, using a larger sample size for adequate statistical power to detect the
      original difference in enrollment rates as significant, should that difference be real and
      reliable. Additional conditions are added after this main comparison in order to compare more
      precisely other pairs of communications conceived in the original study.

      The generic email condition will consist of a standard email of the kind that would typically
      be sent by GHP to encourage enrollment, which includes the average amount saved, the ease of
      registration, and a reward incentive. The loss framing condition will highlight that
      respondents are forfeiting savings unless they take action and register. The two testimonial
      conditions will have a testimonial from a doctor (medical expert condition) or a customer
      care specialist (rank-and-file condition) about how the program helped them. The two social
      norms conditions will show the percentage (percentage condition) or number (number condition)
      of fellow Geisinger members who already signed up. Emails will go out in three waves. For
      each wave, Geisinger employees who have not already registered at that time will be
      randomized into one of two groups:

      Wave 1: generic email vs. loss framing email

      Wave 2: testimonial (expert) vs. testimonial (rank-and-file)

      Wave 3: social norms (percentage) vs. social norms (number)

      It is hypothesized that, on average, the loss frame email will increase enrollment compared
      with the standard email. The other comparisons are exploratory and do not have a priori
      hypotheses. Findings will help inform how best to increase enrollment in a wellness program
      through email communication.

      A double-blind placebo controlled trial of gabapentin in the setting of an ambulatory
      surgical abortion center where patients receive either the routine intravenous sedation,
      local cervical anesthesia plus 600mg of gabapentin one hour prior to surgery vs. the same
      regimen plus placebo one hour prior to surgery. Our primary outcome measure will be
      post-operative validated pain scores using a 11-point visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary
      measures will include nausea and vomiting during, after and 24 hours after the procedure. A

      The use ofcommunication material in communication with patients receiving mechanical
      ventilator support increases patient satisfaction and reduces communication difficulties.
      However, there was no randomized controlled clinical study showing the effect of the use of
      these materials on patient care outcomes such as anxiety and comfort level.Patients were
      randomly assigned to the control groups using illustrated communication material and
      intervention and routine communication methods. The research was carried out in three stages:
      preoperative, intensive care and one day after surgery. The primary outcomes of the study

      This study was phase 1, randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, single-dose study,
      which was designed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of CT-P17 SC
      administration via AI and PFS in healthy subjects. Approximately 180 subjects were enraollend
      and randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. In each treatment arm,
      all subjects received a single dose (40 mg) of CT-P17 via either AI or PFS on Day 1 followed
      by 10 weeks during which PK, safety, and immunogenicity measurements were made. The
      randomization to treatment assignment was stratified by body weight (≥80 kg vs. <80 kg) as
      measured on baseline (Day -1), gender (male vs. female) and study center.

      This study will include up to 100 adults ≥ 18 years of age. The final subject database will
      contain no fewer than 85 subjects with a minimum of 255 paired observations. At least 90% of
      the subjects will contribute 3 paired observations, if necessary the balance of the data will
      be added from additional subjects.

      An interim analysis will be conducted at the end of Part 1 data collection and will consist
      of simple statistics that will compare the test device tot he reference cuff non-invasive

      Part 2 data collection will be conducted after Part 1 data collection interim report is
      reviewed and additional data collection is approved by the client. It will test an additional
      55 subjects (plus extra subjects as replacements if necessary).

      Participants will have two study visits (consent plus treatment and swabs for culture). These
      visits will be conducted at the main UW Hospital, UW Health at the American Center, or UW
      Health at 1 S. Park. All visits will be conducted in reserved conference rooms at each
      location.

      Once a subject is determined to be eligible and has consented to the study, they will be
      randomized into one of three treatment groups. Study team has blank envelopes that contain
      one of the three treatment groups enclosed. After a subject consents to the study, the study
      team will randomly draw an envelope to assign a treatment arm.

      Arm 1. One group will receive 5% topical benzoyl peroxide gel plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate
      with 70% isopropyl alcohol

      Arm 2. One group will receive blue light therapy plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate with 70%
      isopropyl alcohol

      Arm 3. One group will receive both of the above treatments

      All participants will have their contralateral shoulder serve as the control (2%
      chlorhexidine gluconate with 70% isopropyl alcohol only). All treatment will be provided by
      the study team. Participants will also be asked to complete a research intake form.

      If C. acnes does grow for a tissue culture, Investigators plan to bank a colony of the
      bacterium for potential use in a future study. There will be no added risk to research
      subjects as no additional cultures will be taken and samples will be completely anonymized.
      The banked samples will simply be a colony of growth from the culture media for storage for
      possible future use. Samples will be banked for 5 years from the date of study completion
      after which time the samples will be destroyed.

      Unexpected bleeding continues to be an issue that confronts anesthesiologists. Obstetric
      bleeding spearheads as the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. One of the
      hurdles that clinicians confront is a lack of point of care coagulation system that can
      hasten the clinical management strategy in the right direction. Conventional methods take
      considerable time to obtain results. TEG and ROTEM are currently doing the job however these
      two modalities requires expertise and proficient training to perform test and interpret
      results. The level of expertise to run the TEG and ROTEM poses hurdles for providing
      coagulation around the clock as it requires trained operators. What is currently required for
      efficient and effective management of obstetric hemorrhage is a point of care coagulation
      system in the operating room and or labor and delivery suite that is user friendly, easy and
      quick to perform. In this study the investigators will evaluate a new point of care Quantra
      Hemostasis Analyzer system to assess coagulation rapidly with ease.

      Investigators will conduct this study to find the effectiveness of cystoinflation to prevent
      bladder injury in women with adhesions of previous C-sections. This prospective analytic
      longitudinal study will be conducted in Lady Willingdon Hospital, a tertiary care teaching
      hospital affiliated with King Edward Medical University Pakistan, from August 2017 to July
      2019, after approval by the institutional review board of King Edward Medical University,
      Pakistan. The subjects will be randomly allocated to cystoinflation and control groups. The
      healthy pregnant women with previous operative deliveries admitted for elective C-section
      will be counselled and conditioned informed consent will be taken to be included in either
      study group if dense pelvic adhesions will be found during their operation. Adhesiolysis will
      be performed using bladder retro-fill with 300cc saline in the cystoinflation group, and
      without retro-fill in control. We will assess primary outcome by observing bladder injury
      rate, blood loss and operative time. The secondary outcome will be assessed by Urinary tract
      infection, micturition problems and fistula formation during 3month follow up period. The
      cystoinflation will be considered effective if the proportion of bladder injury in the study
      group will be less than 50% of the control group.

      ABSTRACT Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of one
      microhybrid and two bulk-fill resin composites in Class II cavities for up to two years.

      Materials and methods In total, 75 Class II restorations were made in 25 patients, using
      three restorative materials: two nanohybrid bulk-fill resin composites, Sonic Fill (SF) and
      x-tra fil (XF), and a microhybrid composite, Filtek Z-250 (FZ). The restorations were blindly

      This research is a pretest, posttest, follow-up, randomized controlled experimental study.
      The research was carried out in Şehitkamil and Şahinbey districts, which are two central
      districts of Gaziantep Province. 60 parents with disabled children were included in the study
      (intervention: 30 parents, control: 30 parents). The research data was collected as pretest,
      posttest and follow-up test from the intervention group between April and December 2019, and
      the control group between April and September 2019 in three stages. Parental Identification
      Form, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
      (DASS-21), Adult Psychological Resilience Scale (RSA-21) were used as data collection form.
      After the pre-test data was collected, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Based
      Intervention Program was applied to the intervention group in six sessions. The duration of
      each session lasted on average 60-90 minutes. A session was held for each parent once a week.
      The control group participated in the training carried out by the guidance service.

      The intervention programme based on ACT was prepared with the aim of reducing levels of
      psychological inflexibility, caregiver burden, depression, anxiety and stress, and of
      increasing levels of psychological resilience in parents of CSN.

      In the preparation of the interventions and planning of the sessions based on ACT, the
      researcher utilised studies in the literature and the basic ACT training she had received.
      After preparation of the ACT intervention protocol, it was given its final shape by obtaining
      the views of specialists working in this field. The sessions were prepared based on six
      components of psychological flexibility found at the basis of ACT.

      The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of reactive balance training (RBT)
      targeting slipping and tripping on laboratory-induced slips and trips. In an effort to build
      upon prior work, the present study included: 1) a control group receiving an alternative
      balance training intervention; 2) separate training and assessment sessions; 3) alternative
      RBT methods that may be more amenable to work outside the lab compared to prior methods, and
      4) older adult participants receiving individualized training to reduce drop-out. The
      investigators hypothesized that slips after RBT would result in improved reactive balance
      kinematics, and a lower incidence of falls, compared to either initial slips before any
      intervention or after a control intervention. The investigators also hypothesized that trips
      after RBT would result in improved reactive balance kinematics, and a lower incidence of
      falls, compared to either initial trips before any intervention or after a control
      intervention. Results were intended to contribute to knowledge regarding the efficacy of
      alternative methods for RBT, and provide additional evidence regarding its efficacy.

      The effect of three front of pack (FOP) labeling schemes (Mexican Guideline Daily Amounts

      Nutrition labels may modify purchasing behavior. Different labels may influence consumer
      purchasing behaviors in different ways.

      In general, for nutrition labels to have any effect on purchasing decisions, consumers must
      first be exposed to them and perceive the displayed information on the labels. Then, the
      effect will be mediated by consumer understanding. Based on this understanding, consumers may
      use the label to make inferences about the nutritional quality or healthiness of the product,
      which, together with other information (e.g. trust or liking of the label or taste of the
      product) may affect the evaluation of the product and eventually the purchase decision of the
      product.

      GDA provide numeric information on the content of key nutrients in the food product without
      interpreting the information.

      MTL and WL are nutrient-specific labels providing an interpretation of the nutritional
      content of specific nutrients in the product. The MTL uses traffic light colors to indicate
      the high (red) or low (green) content of key nutrients, whereas the WL are only included in a
      product when the content of each key ingredient is above specific criteria.

      Trained undergraduate student research assistants from eight universities across the country
      recruited the study participants. Research assistants were trained on how to approach and
      recruit participants and obtain informed consent. They were instructed to recruit 20 or more
      participants each. Recruitment took place in public spaces previously selected by convenience
      by the research team, based on their use by low- and middle-income groups in Mexico (i.e.,
      public schools, public squares, public health centers, as well as supermarket chains and
      shopping centers located in low-income neighborhoods). Potential participants were approached
      by research assistants, who explained study objectives and invited them to be part of the
      study. Then, individuals were screened for eligibility using a 3-item screener. To access
      this screener, research assistants used a tablet or laptop with internet-access, to access a
      unique web address where our web-based tool was hosted. Research assistants were
      automatically informed by the web-based tool about the eligibility of the participant.
      Informed consent was obtained from all eligible participants using an automated
      computer-based form. Then, the tablet or laptop was handed to participants, who completed a
      self-administered online demographic and health survey, and then accessed the online shopping
      site to simulate a shopping situation. Participants completed the shopping task on the same
      day at the public place where they were recruited.

      After allocation, participants viewed a video explaining how to correctly interpret the
      assigned label. Each participant was asked to shop freely, to better mimic real-world grocery
      shopping conditions. Research assistants instructed participants as follows: ""take into
      account the assigned label and choose your preferred products"". Participants were assigned an
      initial budget to do their shopping, although they did not pay actual money for their
      groceries. This budget corresponded to their weekly expenditure in groceries reported in the
      demographic survey, from 500-5000 Mexican pesos ($28-280 USD), in multiples of 500. No
      specific instructions were given related to the number or total cost of food products
      purchased.

      FOP nutrition labels were affixed on the food items of the virtual supermarket. The store
      displayed the name, price and the front of the pack image of 60 food products from 5 food
      groups (ready-made foods, dairy products, non-dairy beverages, salty snacks, and breakfast
      cereals). Products were shown on traditional shopping shelves. Participants could zoom in to
      look more closely at the products and their prices, and could click on the product to access
      a new pop-up window. This new window displayed product information (i.e., name and brand), a
      larger image of the front of the product packaging, and an area where they could select the
      amount or number of products they wanted to put in their shopping cart. The pop-up window was
      the only way in which participants could select the food products to ""purchase"". Participants
      could also zoom in further on this pop-up to look more closely at the package and the
      nutritional label.

      After completing their shopping, participants revised their shopping cart and ""purchased""
      their products. A brief feedback on the nutritional quality of the products in their shopping
      cart was provided as a retribution for their time.

      The study will use a non-randomized, prospective, single group design. Twenty long-term,
      clinically-stable methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients who receive between 6- and
      13-days methadone take-home doses will be enrolled in the study where their methadone
      take-home administration and dispensing will be transferred to a community pharmacy for 3
      months. Participants will also complete three follow-up assessments at 1-month, 2-months, and
      3-months after the baseline visit to collect clinical and safety information since the
      previous assessment. Primary outcomes will be focused on feasibility measures (recruitment,
      accessibility to methadone treatment, substance use, medication call back success, and
      retention in treatment). Secondary outcomes will be focused on self-reported satisfaction

      This is a single-centre, open-label, Phase Ib study designed to assess if intravenous
      injection of approximately 3200 P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoites can be safely
      administered to achieve blood-stage parasitaemia with a kinetics/PCR profile that will allow
      for the future characterisation of antimalarial blood-stage activity of new chemical entities
      in a relatively small number of participants during early drug development.

      Healthy, malaria-naïve adults, aged 18-55 years, will be enrolled in a maximum of 2 cohorts.
      Enrolment into the cohorts will proceed sequentially, with two target levels of parasitaemia,
      i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 1 and 10000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 2.

      (Based on observed levels of parasitaemia in Cohort 1, the target threshold for treatment in
      Cohort 2 was maintained at 5,000 p/mL (vs 10,000 p/mL in the protocol)).

      The 3-day antimalarial therapy regimen will be further administered and monitored until
      parasite clearance. Safety and tolerability will be monitored during the whole study
      duration.

      Up to 16 healthy, malaria-naïve males and females, aged 18-55 years, will be enrolled in a
      maximum of 2 cohorts (up to 8 participants per cohort; a participant may be enrolled in one
      cohort only). Enrolment into the cohorts will proceed sequentially, with two target levels of
      parasitaemia previously achieved in healthy participants enrolled in malaria Volunteer
      Infection Studies (VIS) at other study sites, i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 1 and
      10000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 2. (Based on observed levels of parasitaemia in Cohort 1,
      the target threshold for treatment in Cohort 2 was maintained at 5,000 p/mL (vs 10,000 p/mL
      in the protocol)).

      Each participant will be admitted to the clinical unit in the morning of Day -1 and
      inoculated with approximately 3200 P. falciparum sporozoites (NF54 strain) by DVI on Day 1.
      Participants will be discharged 2 h post inoculation on Day 1 and will be monitored daily via
      phone call from Day 2 until Day 6 to solicit any AEs. Participants will come to the clinical
      unit daily from Day 7 until Day 9 and together with the malaria clinical score (see
      Attachment 1), the presence of parasites will be assessed once daily by a specific qPCR
      targeting the varATS (the acidic terminal segment in Plasmodium falciparum var genes)
      multigenic family; this to accurately describe parasite growth even in case PCR positivity,
      i.e., a qPCR outcome ≥250 parasites per mL blood, is confirmed this early (very low
      probability and with low densities). Participants will be confined to the clinical unit from
      Day 10 in the morning. qPCR will be performed and malaria clinical score assessed twice daily
      and participants will be administered registered antimalarial therapy, i.e., Riamet®, when
      the following criteria are met:

        1. Cohort 1: ≥5000 parasites/mL blood or earlier if a participant has a malaria clinical
           score >6 or at Investigator's discretion.

        2. Cohort 2: ≥10000 parasites/mL blood or earlier if a participant has a malaria clinical
           score >6 or at Investigator's discretion.

      The registered 3-day antimalarial therapy regimen will be further administered and monitored.
      qPCR assessments of parasitaemia will be carried out at multiple time points (2, 6, 8, 12,
      16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h) following initiation of Riamet® and malaria clinical score will be
      assessed twice daily during confinement in the clinical unit. Safety and tolerability will be
      monitored during the whole study duration, specific assessments will be done at periodic
      pre-specified time points from Day 10 and for at least 72 h after initiating antimalarial
      therapy, i.e., during confinement in the clinical unit (see below).

      Of note, all participants must consent to receiving antimalarial therapy, i.e., the
      registered 3-day Riamet® regimen approved for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Even in the
      case of withdrawal from the study, all participants administered the PfSPZ-DVI Challenge are
      to receive antimalarial therapy as soon as possible, and to have all appropriate visits and
      assessments as required. If an intolerance or contraindication to Riamet® develops, Malarone®
      will be administered.

      Upon parasite clearance (defined as a qPCR value of 0 parasites per mL blood after initiating
      antimalarial therapy) and at least 72 h after initiating antimalarial therapy (estimated to
      occur on or before Day 19 and on or before Day 22 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively),
      and if clinically well, participants will be discharged from the clinical unit and will be
      followed up for safety assessments, clinical evaluation and malaria qPCR in the clinical unit
      at the EOS visit on Day 28. All participants who received antimalarial therapy will be asked
      non-leading questions to determine the occurrence of any AEs throughout the study and at the
      EOS visit. All participants inoculated with PfSPZ-DVI Challenge will commence antimalarial
      therapy no later than Day 24 for both cohorts, regardless if they reach pre-defined
      cohort-specific PCR parasitaemia/malaria clinical score thresholds (i.e., 5000 parasites/mL
      blood for Cohort 1 and 10000 parasites/mL blood for Cohort 2 and/or a malaria clinical score
      ≥6 for Cohorts 1 and 2). Participants who start antimalarial therapy on Day 24 will only be
      discharged from confinement at the end of the EOS visit on Day 28. Antimalarial therapy may
      be initiated whenever deemed necessary by the Investigators, e.g., if there is a concern
      regarding the safety of a study participant. Therapy may be amended according to the treating
      physician if the participant does not respond to treatment or the condition worsens.

      This study aims to compare the effects of Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy and wet-to-dry
      dressing on Stages 3 and 4 pressure injuries, and to investigate the consistency of
      Three-Dimensional Wound Measurement Device findings with Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing
      Tool scores. This study is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 patients with Stages
      3 and 4 pressure injuries were included in the study. The patients were divided into two
      groups: the experimental group or Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy group and the control or
      wet-to-dry dressing group. All patients received 3 rounds of treatment. Data were collected
      with a Patient Identification Form, Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing Tool and the findings of
      Three-Dimensional Wound Measurement Device. We found that granulation tissue formation was
      more significant in the experimental group (p < .05), and that there was more significant
      wound shrinkage (p < .05) with a more significant decrease in the Pressure Ulcer Scale for
      Healing Tool scores (p < .05). The wounds were assessed with the Tool and the
      Three-Dimensional Wound Measurement device. Device measurements were found to be correlated
      with Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing Tool Tool findings (p < .05) There was a significant
      correlation between device-measured granulation findings and PUSH Tool score results of the
      experimental group's third measurements (p < .05). We conclude that Negative-Pressure Wound
      Therapy is an effective treatment method for pressure injuries, and Three-Dimensional Wound
      Measurement device is an usable wound assessment tool.

      Pressure injuries are a major health problem in that they are difficult to treat, reduce the
      patients' quality of life, and increase length of hospital stay and overall health care
      costs. Furthermore, several possible wound healing complications, such as infections, can
      lead to mortality. That said, the prevalence of pressure injuries is an important indicator
      of quality in hospitals. Pressure injuries do not only impact health, but also cause social
      isolation and dependency, resulting in further psychological problems.

      Our review of the literature revealed that the incidence of pressure ulcers varies between
      0.4% and 38% in hospitalized patients, between 2.2 and 23.9% in intensive care units and
      between 0-17% in home care. NPUAP (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel) reports that the
      cost of treating pressure ulcers has been gradually increasing. It was estimated that
      treating pressure injuries costs around $11 billion annually in the United States alone.
      Treating a pressure ulcer can cost anywhere between $500 to $70,000, the most substantial
      fraction being nursing services. In the UK, it costs £1,064 to treat a Stage 1 pressure
      injury, and this number can reach £10,551 for more advanced ulcers. This illustrates the
      direct link between the stage of pressure injury and the cost of treatment. On average, it
      costs the UK healthcare system £1.4-2.1 billion annually to treat pressure ulcers.

      There are many products and methods available for pressure ulcer treatment, but the most
      well-known and most commonly preferred method is wet-to-dry dressing. That said, researchers
      have tried and developed several novel methods for the treatment of pressure injuries
      including NPWT (Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, ultrasonography,
      hydrotherapy, magnetic field therapy, ultraviolet rays, electrical stimulation, phototherapy
      and growth hormone application. Together with these non-invasive treatment methods, surgical
      intervention can also be a treatment option, especially for non-healing wounds. The European
      and US National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panels' (EPUAP and NPUAP) guidelines recommend NPWT
      for deep-tissue pressure injuries, namely Stages 3 and 4, as a supportive tool for
      early-stage treatment. This method is based on applying negative pressure to promote wound
      healing. Several studies report that NPWT increases granulation tissue formation and reduces
      wound area. It is indicated that NPWT provides continuous and effective wound debridement in
      the wound area and increases blood supply to the wound.

      Pressure injuries are among the most significant current health problems that are handled by
      a medical nurse. As the primary caregiver for the hospitalized patient, the nurse must
      prioritize preventing wound formation and eliminating any risk factors. If a pressure sore
      does form, the primary goal is to plan and implement appropriate care and nursing
      interventions in collaboration with the patient and their family to ensure proper wound
      healing .

      It is the nurse's responsibility to keep up with scientific developments in patient care and
      try to integrate them into their work. PUSH is a tool that is used for monitoring pressure
      ulcers; however, it has yet to become a part of routine practice in Turkey. The
      Three-Dimensional Wound Management (3-DWM) device has been used in medical service since
      2015, but with only a limited number of studies that evaluate its effectiveness. Currently,
      the wet-to-dry dressing method is the most commonly preferred treatment method for wound care
      in Turkish healthcare. There are indeed numerous studies that demonstrate the effectiveness
      of wet dressings in wound healing. Wet dressings provide the appropriate medium for the
      accumulation of patient's own body fluids between wound surface and dressing while preventing
      dehydration. This study aims to compare the effects of Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT)
      and wet-to-dry dressing on Stages 3 and 4 pressure injuries, and to investigate the
      consistency of 3-DWM device measurement findings with PUSH Tool scores.

      The Supertowel is a microfiber towel treated with a permanent anti-microbial bonding and has
      been designed as a soap alternative in emergency situations.The treated fabric must be dipped
      in water and then rubbed against the hands so that pathogens will be transferred to the
      fabric where they will be killed. Over the last two years the investigators have been able to
      prove, under controlled laboratory conditions, that hand cleaning with the Supertowel is more
      efficacious than handwashing soap and water. Another field study conducted by the
      investigators in a refugee camp in Northern Ethiopia indicated that the Supertowel is an
      acceptable and desirable product among crisis-affected populations and is likely to result in
      more frequent handwashing in these difficult circumstances.

      The aim of this study is to develop greater evidence on whether the Supertowel remains is as
      efficacious when used under conditions which mimic ""real-world hand cleaning conditions"".

      The Supertowel is a microfiber towel treated with a permanent anti-microbial bonding and has
      been designed as a soap alternative in emergency situations.

      The treated fabric must be dipped in water and then rubbed against the hands so that
      pathogens will be transferred to the fabric where they will be killed. Several laboratory
      test have demonstrated the bactericidal effect of the fabric against different bacteria. The
      Supertowel will kill microbes efficiently and within seconds once the microbe is on the
      towel. The Supertowel provides an alternative to large-scale soap distribution. It could be
      beneficial to emergency responders as it will be easier (smaller and lighter) to distribute
      and last longer than soap, negating the need for frequent distributions. The Supertowel will
      reduce water wastage associated with hand washing and reduce drainage problems that are often
      seen around hand washing facilities. The Supertowel will also be beneficial to those effected
      by emergencies as it can easily be carried by users all the time, making hand cleaning more
      convenient.

      Over the last two years the investigators have been able to prove, under controlled
      laboratory conditions, that hand cleaning with the Supertowel is more efficacious than
      handwashing soap and water. Another field study conducted by the investigators in a refugee
      camp in Northern Ethiopia indicated that the Supertowel is an acceptable and desirable
      product among crisis-affected populations and is likely to result in more frequent
      handwashing in these difficult circumstances.

      The aim of this study is to develop greater evidence on whether the Supertowel remains is as
      efficacious when used under conditions which mimic ""real-world hand cleaning conditions"".
      This will be tested through a set of controlled laboratory experiments with healthy
      volunteers in India. We will be testing the efficacy of the Supertowel as a hand-cleaning
      product using simulations of 'real-world' hand cleaning conditions.

      To test the efficacy of the Supertowel under the different conditions, we will use a
      crossover controlled study based and adapted on the protocol of the European Committee for
      Standardization (EN 1499) which is designed to evaluate the ability of hand-wash agents to
      eliminate transient pathogens from volunteers' hands without regard to resident
      microorganisms. This procedure is based on the ""post-contamination treatment"" of hands and
      involves the placement of the test organism (E. coli [ATCC 11229]) on the hands of test
      subjects, followed by exposure of the test product.

      The study will be organized in two rounds of tests. 32 healthy volunteers will be selected
      for the study. 16 volunteers will be invited for the first round and 16 more for the second
      round. Each volunteer will receive treatment with all the different procedures the same day
      of visit to the laboratory.

      This is a single centre study conducted in KET's Scientific Research Centre, Mumbai (India).
      The recruitment and performance of tests will be done at KET's Scientific Research Centre,
      Mumbai (India) Laboratory of India.

      School meals have considerable potential to shape children's diets and reduce the climate
      impact of meals. This study applies linear programming for developing and implementing a
      climate friendly, nutritious and affordable school lunch menu. The new menu plan will be
      compared to the baseline menu during a 4-week intervention trial. The outcomes will be food
      waste, consumption, and pupils' satisfaction with the meals before and after introducing the
      new meal plan analyzed by interrupted time series analysis. Our hypothesis is that school
      meals can be optimized to be nutritious and more climate friendly, without negatively
      affecting acceptance, food waste and cost.

      Four primary schools in one Swedish municipality with the same menu plan for all schools will
      participate in the study. Their current meal supply will be recorded in the form of a food
      list including amount and cost of each item over a 4-week period. This list will then be
      optimized with linear programming to be as similar as possible to the baseline diet but with
      a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 30%. No new foods will be introduced and
      none will be removed from the list. Nutritionally adequacy will be ensured by including
      constraints into the model. The optimized food list will be handed to the municipality's meal
      planner and a new menu plan will be developed based on the revised food list. Data on food
      waste and consumption will be collected daily during a baseline period of four weeks, and
      during the four-week intervention period. School lunch satisfaction will be assessed twice
      with an online questionnaire at baseline and during the intervention.
    ",,,,,,,,31-Dec-21,Actual,,"
      For a period of four weeks, during the spring term of 2020, children from four primary
      schools in Uppsala municipality will receive a new school lunch menu plan which has been
      optimized through linear programming to be as similar as possible to the baseline menu while
      having about 30% lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), being nutritionally adequate, and not
      more expensive.

      During the fall of 2019, a meeting was held with the public meal administration in the
      municipality of Uppsala. The research team described the OPTIMAT project, including the
      previously developed strategy for optimizing and implementing more climate friendly lunches
      in schools. Following this meeting, the municipality agreed to take part in the project. The
      municipality's meal planner proposed four primary schools for the study, presently having the
      highest food related GHGE in public meals in the municipality. To be eligible, the
      intervention schools were required to have on-site kitchens as well as being able to provide
      electronic recipes for a standard four-week menu. All proposed schools fulfilled these
      criteria and approved participation.

      Recipes for an original (baseline) four-week school lunch menu plan previously served at the
      recruited schools were obtained through the municipality's electronic meal planning system.
      The foods included and amounts are considered as the baseline food supply. Each food item
      included has a code that can be coupled to the Swedish national food database and a national
      climate database for foods containing life cycle data for each food item. This baseline food
      supply will be optimized using linear programming. The optimized food list, not including new
      foods or excluding any foods from the baseline list, will be handed to the municipality's
      meal planner who develops a new menu plan for the intervention using all foods on the
      optimized list.

      To assess the effect of the new menu plan, data on food waste and consumption will be
      collected daily in each intervention school four weeks before (baseline) as well as during
      the four-week intervention with a one-week brake between measurement periods. Kitchen staff
      will perform daily weighting (using school kitchen scales) of all food prepared in the
      kitchen (prepared food); the share of the prepared food that is not eaten and has to be
      thrown away (serving waste); the share that can be saved (leftover food); and plate waste.
      Total plate waste, plate waste per pupil, serving waste, total consumption, and consumption
      per pupil will be considered as the primary outcomes as they are regarded as directly related
      to the pupils' acceptability of the new menu. Data on school meal satisfaction will also be
      collected through an anonymous online questionnaire at baseline and during the last week of
      the intervention period. Pupils in grade 8 will answer the questionnaire containing ten
      questions related to the school lunch.

      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers
      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. These
      vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs,
      and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling,
      and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can
      influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.

      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes
      (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from
      different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and
      outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect
      on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.

      This clinical study will be performed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of aerosol
      inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo)
      in healthy volunteers.

      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes
      (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from
      different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and
      outcome were improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the similar therapeutic effect
      on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.

      Although human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and
      septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs.
      The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured
      microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by
      treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility
      of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed
      therapeutic use.

      The purpose of this study, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency as well as
      provide a clinical dose reference for the subsequent trails of aerosol inhalation of MSCs-Exo
      in the treatment of severe lung diseases (including severe lung infection, acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc.)

      After endotracheal intubation verifying the location of endotracheal tube is of utmost
      importance. Many methods have been applied but none is perfect. The standard practice in the
      investigator's center has been to use auscultation of chest with capnography.

      Ultrasound machines are now gaining popularity and their access extends from operation
      theatres, emergency rooms and even many primary health centres. Both capnography and
      ultrasonography are safe.

      This study found out that Ultrasonography and waveform capnography are both reliable methods
      of confirming endotracheal tube position. The use of ultrasound could help reduce time and
      increase precision of confirming endotracheal tube position. Ultrasound can confirm
      endotracheal tube position before manual bag ventilations, and thus may prevent aspiration of
      gastric contents into patient's lungs.

      This was a prospective, observational study conducted at the Tribhuvan University Teaching
      Hospital (TUTH) and Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Center (MCVTC) operating
      rooms from January 2017 to July 2017. Ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Department of Anaesthesiology, Maharajgunj
      Medical College (MMC) was taken. Written informed consent was taken.

      ASA I and II patients over 16 years of age were included in this study. Patients with
      difficult airway and anticipated difficult intubation, respiratory diseases, poor functional
      status, emergency case, and patients at risk of aspiration were excluded.

      The diagnostic characteristics of real-time, suprasternal, transtracheal ultrasonography and
      capnography were tested by calculating their respective sensitivities, specificities,
      positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracies and likelihood
      ratios. Comparison of time taken for confirmation of endotracheal tube position from the
      beginning of laryngoscopy, by ultrasonography versus capnography was done using t-statistics.

      The degree of agreement of result between ultrasonography and capnography was tested with
      kappa statistics.

      Out of the 95 patients studied, 11 had oesophageal intubation (Incidence of 11.57%). The
      overall accuracy of both ultrasonography and capnography was 96.84%. The sensitivity,
      specificity, PPV, NPV with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
      ultrasonography were 97.62% (91.66% - 99.71%), 90.91% (58.72% - 99.77%), 98.80% (92.67% -
      99.81%), 83.33% (55.66% - 95.22%) respectively; and that for capnography were 96.43% (89.92%
      - 99.26%), 100% (71.51% - 100%), 100% (100% - 100%) and 78.57% (54.69% - 91.76%)
      respectively.

      The likelihood ratio of a positive and a negative result for ultrasonography were 10.74 and
      0.03 respectively, and that for capnography were infinity and 0.04 respectively.

      The kappa value was 0.749 (95% CI: 0.567 - 0.931) which meant a good degree of agreement of
      result between these two methods.

      The average time taken for confirmation of endotracheal tube by ultrasonography and
      capnography were 26.79 ± 7.64 seconds and 43.03 ± 8.71 seconds (mean ± standard deviation)
      respectively. The median time for confirmation was 26 seconds with interquartile range [15 -
      37] seconds for ultrasonography and 42 seconds with interquartile range [29 - 55] seconds for
      capnography. Ultrasonography was found to be faster than capnography by 16.36 ± 3.23 seconds
      (mean ± standard deviation) and the difference in time was significant (p = 0.011).

      During the study, one patient had unanticipated difficult intubation, and four had
      hypotension after induction of anaesthesia. These patients were excluded from the study and
      no sequalae of hypotension was seen in the patients, or no hypoxemia occured in the patient
      with unanticipated difficult intubation.

      The objective of this study is to provide remote mindfulness session(s) to help during the
      COVID-19 pandemic.The investigators are interested in targeting patients with migraine,
      providers, faculty and staff. The investigators are hopeful that this will positively impact
      overall well-being at this stressful time. The investigators are interested in assessing
      feasibility, accessibility, and overall interest of an online mindfulness intervention in
      these populations at this time.

      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the most frequent primary bariatric
      procedure performed worldwide. LSG is safe and effective in terms of excess weight loss. It
      is a powerful metabolic operation that activates significant hormonal pathways that lead to
      changes in eating behaviour, glycemic control and intestinal functions. LSG is easier
      regarding its technical aspects and does not need any intestinal anastomosis, begin limited
      to the stomach. The most frequent and sometimes dangerous complications are leaking,
      haemorrhage, splenic injury, sleeve stenosis and gastroesophageal reflux. Despite its
      established efficacy and safety, controversy still exists on optimal operative technique for
      LSG: bougie size, the distance of resection margin from the pylorus, the shape of the section
      at the gastroesophageal junction, staple line reinforcement and intraoperative leak testing
      is among the most controversial issues 11[6]. In literature, different authors have adopted a
      resection distance from the pylorus between 2 and 6-7 cm with various reasons 11[6].
      Resections more distant to the pylorus improve gastric emptying, prevent distal stenosis and
      reduce intraluminal pressure, potentially leading to a lower incidence of fistula and/or
      reflux. On the other hand, resections close to the pylorus would reduce gastric
      distensibility and increase intragastric pressure, potentially increasing satiety with less
      oral intake 11(11,12). The primary aim of this randomized monocentric study is to evaluate
      %EWL at 1 and 2 years follow-up after LSG in two Groups: Group A with a gastric resection
      starting from 2 cm from the pylorus with therefore a wide antrectomy and Group B with a
      gastric resection starting from 6 cm from the pylorus with therefore a small antrectomy.

      Cesarean delivery is one of the most common major abdominal operation in women worldwide. The
      incidence of postpartum infection has been estimated to be 1-4% after vaginal delivery and
      10-20% after Cesarean delivery. Although it is widely performed, manual removal of the
      placenta is still a conflicting issue due to the risk of post-partum endometritis. All
      cesarean patients are randomized according to the removal of placenta from the uterus after
      childbirth; manually (Group 1) or controlled cord traction without putting fingers inside the
      uterus (Group 2). The aim of this study is to examine whether there is an association between
      the method of removal of the placenta and postpartum white blood cell increase in nonanemic,
      singleton, low-risk group of women with term pregnancies, who underwent elective cesarean
      delivery under general anesthesia.

      Objective:

      Cesarean section is one of the most common major abdominal operation in women worldwide and
      its rate is increasing every year. Although cesarean birth is considered as safe, it is a
      potentially morbid procedure with associated risks of hemorrhage, thromboembolic events,
      infection, and anesthesia risks. The incidence of postpartum infection has been estimated to
      be 1-4% after vaginal delivery and 10-20% after cesarean section. Manual removal of the
      placenta is widely accepted by surgeons worldwide. This method enables the surgeon quick
      intervention. Beside, it helps uterine cavity to be examined for damage and the presence of
      placental remnants. However, manual removal of the placenta is still a conflicting issue due
      to the risk of post-partum endometritis, post-partum hemorrhage and abnormal placentation in
      subsequent pregnancies. It is assumed that controlled cord traction reduces the risk of
      postpartum hemorrhage and infection.

      The aim of this study is to examine whether there is an association between the method of
      removal of the placenta and increase in postpartum white blood cell counts

      After informed consent, all patients are randomized according to the removal of placenta from
      the uterus after childbirth; manually (Group 1) or controlled cord traction without putting
      hands inside the uterus (Group 2). Patients are examined regarding to maternal infection. BMI
      measurement, obstetrics and medical history are recorded. The operative procedures are
      similar in all patients and followed the same technical steps. In both groups, oxytocin and a
      first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic are administered intravenously after the delivery
      of the infant. All uterine incisions were low transverse and all were closed without
      exteriorisation of the uterus. Complete blood count before delivery, on pastpartum day 1 and
      2, fever during hospitalisation, average blood loss during operation and the endometritis
      cases are recorded. All the patients are asked to come to control on postpartum day 10. Also,
      patients are asked to come to control if they have fever, abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal
      vaginal discharge, general feeling of sickness and pain in the pelvis. Fever is defined as a
      temperature above 38.5°C on two consecutive days, excluding the first 24 hours.

      A growing body of research indicates that abnormal ocular microvascular features may serve as
      a novel biomarker reflecting the severity of underlying cardiovascular, neurodegenerative,
      and microvascular disease. Since blood flow to the retina is predominantly supplied by the
      internal carotid artery (ICA), we hypothesized that ocular microvasculature and structure
      changes may reflect the disease status or therapeutic effects in patients with carotid artery
      stenosis.

      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel, non-invasive imaging modality
      that can be a reliable tool for the qualitative and quantitative assessments of ocular
      vessels during various ocular pathological or physiological changes. Recent studies have also
      demonstrated the ability of OCTA to quantify retinal microvascular changes in monitoring
      cardiovascular risk.

      This study aims to evaluate ocular changes in patients with carotid artery stenosis by
      optical coherence tomography angiography before and after carotid artery revascularization
      procedure.In this study, the patients with carotid artery stenosis and control group will
      receive a series of cerebral and ocular examinations including the most important cerebral CT
      perfusion (CTP) and OCTA. After that, the cerebral and ocular data between the two groups
      will be compared. Also, the preoperative and postoperative data acquired will be compared.

      Healthcare workers are at the frontline of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. They
      will be randomised to receive a single dose of BCG vaccine or 0.9% NaCl placebo. Participants
      will be followed-up for 12 months with notification from a Smartphone application or phone
      calls (up to daily when ill) and surveys to identify and detail COVID-19 infection.
      Additional information on severe disease will be obtained from hospital medical records
      and/or government databases. Blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and at 3,
      6, 9 and 12 months to determine exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Where required, swab/blood samples will be taken at illness episodes to assess
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The trial includes a pre-planned meta-analysis with data from 2834 participants recruited in
      the Stage 1 of this study, where participants were randomised to receive BCG or no BCG
      vaccine at the time of receiving influenza vaccination.

      This is a randomized, multi-center, placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid) controlled, blinded
      study of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for the prevention of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults exposed to the virus.The overarching goal of this study is to
      assess the effectiveness of HCQ PEP on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection by polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) to inform public health control strategies.This study will enroll up to
      2000 asymptomatic men and women 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive) at baseline who are close
      contacts of persons with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or clinically suspected COVID-19 and a
      pending SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to HCQ
      or ascorbic acid at the level of the household (all eligible participants in one household
      will receive the same intervention). Participants will be counseled about the preliminary in
      vitro data on HCQ activity against SARS CoV-2 and equipoise regarding efficacy in humans.The
      duration of study participation will be approximately 28 days.

      The Focused Assessment of Sonography for Trauma (FAST) is a rapid point-of-care ultrasound
      exam performed on blunt and penetrating trauma patients who are too critically injured to be
      transported to a CT scanner. Low-frequency ultrasound is used to image the abdomen and
      pericardium in these patients, using either a curvilinear transducer or a phased-array
      transducer. Whether the use of one transducer or the other is better for this application is
      not well studied. In this study, physician ultrasound operators will perform the FAST exam on
      healthy non-injured volunteers to determine if the speed or quality of images between the two

      The Focused Assessment of Sonography for Trauma (FAST) is a rapid point-of-care ultrasound
      exam performed on blunt and penetrating trauma patients who are too critically injured to be
      transported to a CT scanner. In performing this exam, time to acquisition of adequate images
      is crucial to clinical decision-making as patients undergoing this exam have a high
      probability of deteriorating if not intervened on appropriately.

      Low-frequency ultrasound is used to image the abdominal cavity and pericardium in these
      patients, using either a curvilinear transducer or a phased-array transducer. Both of these
      transducers are capable of acquiring the images necessary to interpret a FAST exam, but it
      has not been well studied whether using one transducer instead of the other improves time to
      image acquisition or image quality.

      In this study, physician ultrasound operators are asked to perform FAST exams on healthy
      non-injured volunteers for the purpose of determining if there is a difference in the time to
      acquisition or quality of images between phased-array and curvilinear transducers.

      This is a double blind, placebo controlled study in approximately 2,000 health care workers
      at risk for being exposed to COVID-19. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1)
      to either treatment group (HCQ) or placebo in a double-blind fashion. After enrollment,
      baseline assessments will include nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 and a blood sample to
      detect seroconversion to COVID-19. For convenience, follow-up will be performed weekly
      through a direct to participant portal. A call center will provide support for any missed
      visits. Follow-up includes screening for any COVID-19 clinical infections, other respiratory
      infections, clinical events, adverse events, and Quality of Life (QoL) assessments. Course of
      treatment is 30 days. Participants are followed via survey weekly. At the end of treatment
      participants will return for repeat nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 and a blood sample to
      detect seroconversion to COVID-19. There will be one last contact at 8 weeks (2 months) from
      baseline.

      Nearly 50 million people in the U.S. experience tinnitus, of which about 20 million people
      have burdensome chronic tinnitus. Tinnitus can be very debilitating as many aspects of daily
      life can be affected, such as sleep, mood, and concentration. Currently, there is no cure for
      tinnitus. Pharmacological or sound-therapy based interventions are sometimes provided but may
      be of limited value to certain individuals. Research suggests that Cognitive Behavior Therapy
      (CBT) based approaches have the most evidence of effectiveness in the management of tinnitus.
      However, CBT is rarely offered to tinnitus sufferers in the U.S. (less than 1%), partly
      because of lack of trained professionals who can deliver CBT. To improve access to CBT for
      tinnitus, an online CBT program has been developed which is also available in Spanish.
      However, the outcomes of the Spanish version of the program has not been evaluated. The
      purpose of the current study is to determine the feasibility of guided Spanish version of the
      Internet-based CBT (ICBT) using audiological support on tinnitus distress and
      tinnitus-related comorbidities.

      Objective: The purpose of the current study is to determine the feasibility of guided Spanish
      version of the Internet-based CBT (ICBT) using audiological support on tinnitus distress and
      tinnitus-related comorbidities.

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that Spanish version of the ICBT will reduce the
      tinnitus-related distress, decrease sleep disturbance, decrease anxiety and depression, and
      improve health-related quality of life in Spanish speaking tinnitus suffers. The
      investigators also hypothesize that these results will be stable in both short- and long-term
      post-intervention.

      Design: A single group assignment, with a one-year follow-up design will be used to evaluate
      the feasibility of Spanish version of the ICBT on tinnitus distress.

      Setting: This will be an Internet-based study for Spanish speaking tinnitus suffers living
      across the globe.

      Participants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of
      3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 50 Spanish
      speaking participants will be recruited.

      Intervention: The intervention offered is a guided CTB-based internet intervention (ICBT),
      providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday
      life. It is 8-week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and
      assignments are given to practice techniques learned.

      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary
      outcome measures are the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS), Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire
      (TCQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia
      Severity Index (ISI), and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L VAS.

      This study aims to enable delivery of a multi-component intervention comprising of strategies
      based on Disease Control Priorities 3rd edition for management of hypertension among
      hypertensive patients. The secondary objective is to test the feasibility, acceptability and
      adaptability of a multi-component intervention delivered at a tertiary level health-care
      facility in the cultural context of Pakistan. A formative research study was conducted before
      so as to develop and test the intervention in a tertiary care hospital setting. The
      investigators employed qualitative research methods to explore the feasibility,
      applicability, and acceptance of DCP3 based intervention comprising of strategies for
      hypertension management. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with selected study
      participants were conducted at Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC/NIHD), Rawalpindi
      for which a prior written and verbal consent was obtained from all research participants. The

      Objective: This study aimed to assess whether pediatric dental anxiety is due to the day of
      dental appointment, to the dental chair, or to the dental treatment procedure during the
      course of the first dental treatment in children.

      Study Design: Salivary cortisol samples were taken on three sequential days (pre-treatment,
      treatment and post-treatment days) and during the beginning and at ~15th minute of treatment,
      and at 15th minute post-treatment in children. They received (n=135; 15/group) root-canal
      treatment, pulpotomy, two- and one-surface restoration with and without local anesthesia;
      fluoride (with arch tray or cotton roll) or fissure sealant applications. Heart rate and SpO2
      (peripheral oxygen saturation ) were monitored and The Facial Image Scale (FIS) and
      Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental subscales (CFSS-DS) were filled.

      The study was carried out following the approval by the local ethics committee (Malatya
      Clinical Studies Ethics Committee, 2017/76), and informed consent was signed by the parents.
      A total of 135 children (69 females 51.1%, 66 males 49.9%), aged 7-8 years (7.37±0.48 years),
      were admitted to Inonu University Faculty of Dentistry Department of Pediatric Dentistry. The
      study was planned with 135 children with 15 children in each group. For that purpose 9 groups
      were formed as 6 restorative and 3 protective applications. The restorative treatment groups
      included procedures with- and without-local anesthesia (LA). Procedures with LA included the
      groups as root canal treatment, pulpotomy, two-surface restoration and one-surface
      restoration. Procedures without LA included the groups as two-surface restoration and
      one-surface restoration. The protective application groups included the groups as fluoride
      application (by disposable arch tray or by cotton roll) and fissure sealant. The diagnosis
      and treatments were carried out by the same dentist (BA).Frankl's Behaviours Rating Scale
      (FBRS) is a method that is frequently used in studies based on the rating of behaviours.
      Children's attitudes during the dental examination were evaluated using FBRS. Behaviours of
      the child are examined in four groups in FBRS: definitely negative (Frankl-1), negative
      (Frankl-2), positive (Frankl-3), and definitely positive (Frankl-4).In terms of the
      standardization of the groups, only the children who were compatible with Frankl-3 or 4
      classes were included in the study. Children with Farnkl-1 and -2 classes had negative
      compliance to treatment and therefore they were not included in the study. The patients were
      grouped according to treatment needs. Each patient who participated in the study was informed
      about the treatment to be applied to him/her and the measurements to be performed by using
      the tell-show-apply behavior method. Furthermore, the child informed the dentist about any
      discomforting stimuli by ""raising his/her left hand up"" and the dentist stopped when he/she
      received this warning. In the groups treated with local anesthesia, banana or strawberry
      flavored topical anesthetic gel (Vision Dental Pat Gel, WP Dental, Germany) that children
      might like was applied first. Then, the local anesthetic solution [Ultracain D-S ampoule (40
      mg articain + 0.012 mg epinephrine) Aventis Pharma, Istanbul, Turkey] was injected by the
      traditional method with the help of a 2 cc set inject plastic dental injector (Tıbset Sterile
      Medical Equipment Industry Istanbul, Turkey). Only conventional root canal treatment and
      extirpation were planned for the children included in the root canal treatment group in the
      measurement session. In the groups to be treated with pulpotomy, it was noted that at least
      one of the approximal surfaces of the teeth had decay and iron sulfate (ViscoStat®,
      UltraDent, South Jordan, USA) was used as pulpotomy material. A Tofflemire matrix retainer
      and 0.05 mm thick matrix band (Hahnenkratt, Königsbach-Stein, Germany) were used in groups
      with a two-surface cavity. 2% NaF (Polimo® IMICRYL, Konya, Turkey) was preferred in groups
      who received fluoride application.

      An aerator and micromotor were used as cavity preparation in the restorative treatment
      groups. Only the micromotor was used for polishing purposes in the protective treatment
      groups. FIS (Facial Image Scale) was assessed at three stages: at the moment they sat in the
      dental chair, 15 minutes after the start of the treatment, and 15 minutes after the end of
      the treatment. From the moment the patient sat in the dental chair, the probe of the bed-side
      monitor was attached to the patient's left index finger, and his/her heart rate and SpO2
      (peripheral oxygen saturation ) of were monitored during the treatment period and the data
      were recorded. After the treatment of the patients was completed in that appointment, the
      CFSS-DS (Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscales) was filled in by the patients
      under the supervision of their parents. In the mornings, 3 salivary samples were taken from
      the patients by their parents in the home environment, i.e. one day before the treatment, on
      the day of treatment and one day after the treatment. The non-stimulated total saliva was
      collected from the patients. The parents were warned about the fact that all of the three
      salivary samples should be taken at the 30th minute after awakening, between 07:00 and 07:30
      am. Eating, drinking, brushing the teeth and using dental care products were not allowed.
      During the treatment period in the clinic, salivary samples were taken between 09.00 and
      11.00 am. Saliva samples were taken in 3 stages, i.e. at the beginning of the treatment, at
      the 15th minute of the treatment, and 15 minutes after the end of the treatment. Sampling at
      15th minute of the treatment process was standardized to correspond to the cavity with an
      aerator (at the enamel level) in restorative treatment groups and to the stage of polishing
      procedure with a micro motor in protective treatment groups. These measures were taken to
      prevent the saliva from contaminating the cavity.

      Managing and taking medications as prescribed can be a difficult task. This is especially
      true for older adults living at home with chronic conditions while managing multiple
      prescribed medications. In response, Catalyst Healthcare has adopted an integrated medication
      dispensing system that intends to improve patient adherence to medications and quality of
      care through real-time pharmacists and caregiver support.Catalyst Healthcare has launched an
      integrated at-home medication dispenser system called spencer. Spencer is a natural extension
      that plugs into Catalyst's AdhereNet platform, connecting high-risk patients in home care
      setting to a multi-disciplinary care team in real-time. Study is funded by the Centre of
      Aging and Brain Health Innovation (CABHI).

      Investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial with a target sample size of 100
      participants to examine the efficacy of an in-home electronic medication dispensing system
      (MDS) on improving medication adherence in community-dwelling older adults with chronic
      conditions. 50 of these participants will be assigned to the intervention group (medication
      management with Spencer) and 50 will be assigned to the control group (medication management
      without Spencer). Medication adherence and patient-related data will be collected over a
      six-month period. Participants health status and characteristics will be obtained through
      baseline assessment upon enrollment. A monthly follow-up survey will be completed to collect
      medication management and adherence data. Adherence data for spencer-users will be collected
      from Catalyst Healthcare technology platform. In the control group, adherence will be
      measured through monthly medication logs completed by participants.

      Purpose: It is estimated by 2045, one in five Albertans in Canada will be 65 or older.
      Medication compliance in the senior population is a significant challenge for optimizing
      patient outcomes. This has significant implications when nearly 69% of medication related
      hospitalizations are attributed to non-adherence and the estimated cost to the Canadian
      Health care system is $7-$9 billion. The factors that contribute to poor medication adherence
      are multifactorial. For example, multiple medications within a treatment regimen, increased
      frequency of medication intake and a prolonged course of drug therapy all contribute to
      decreased medication adherence. Almost 2/3 of those aged 65 and over take five or more
      prescription drugs thus increasing the risk of adherence issues.

      Therefore, therapeutic management of multiple chronic diseases can only be realized when the
      individual is adherent to their prescribed pharmacological regimen. Age-related innovations
      provide an enormous opportunity to enhance the quality of life for seniors and reduce
      healthcare cost related to medication adherence issues. The spencer medication dispensing
      device is a new integrated technology that improves medication compliance and offers
      independence to seniors at home while providing real-time pharmacist and caregiver support.
      Alberta Health Services (AHS) is committed to supporting and strengthening community care by
      adopting age-related innovations. Hence, the aim of study is to evaluate user benefits and
      effectiveness of the device for improving medication compliance in older adults and seniors
      population.

      Primary Research Question: Does the spencer system improve medication adherence in
      individuals 50 year or older living in the community taking five plus medications?

      Study Design: This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with the spencer device will be
      conducted from March 2019 to June 2020 in Calgary, Alberta. The data will be collected over a
      six-month period, the spencer deployment will begin in April 2019 and will continue till
      September 2019. This is a proof of concept study for which no formal sample size calculation
      is required. A total of 100 study participants will be recruited in the study (50
      intervention group and 50 in the control group). The investigators will randomly place a
      participant in either the intervention group to use spencer or into the control group to
      continue the using their current method of management.

      Randomization: The investigators will be using block randomization which is the recommended
      method for sample sizes of 50 or less in each group to balance the groups in terms of the
      number of subjects they contain, and in the distribution of potential confounding variables.
      The study is not blinded so the blocks will vary in sizes (10, 12, 14) to reduce the
      predictability of the intervention assignment. A project assistant (a contracted staff which
      will not be involved in data collection or analysis activities) will produce
      computer-generated sets of random allocations in advance of the study and then sealed in
      consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. Once the participants has given consent to be
      included in the study, he/she will then be irreversibly randomized by opening the next sealed
      envelope containing his/her assignment.

      Technology Intervention: The spencer device comprises interactive tools to optimize
      medication adherence and clinical outcomes. The device dispenses the patient's medications on
      time with reminders by sending visual and audio alerts. The sound of the audio alerts get
      louder if the medication pouch is not removed from the device by the patient. Patient have
      two hour window to remove the medication pouch. If not removed, patients are considered
      non-adherent for that particular time frame. Spencer allows individuals to dispense their
      medication early if away from home. Medication adherence is tracked through spencer Care
      platform. The medication adherence is based on an assumption that medication was administered
      by a patient once the pouch was removed from the device.

      Also, spencer uses a multi-disciplinary approach of care team members including pharmacists,
      caregivers and spencer medication adherence platform to provide healthcare in to the homes of
      the high-risk, chronically-ill population. The device supports a personalized plan that
      tracks medication adherence and response to therapy. Spencer displays personalized and
      condition specific questions to meet the individual goals of patients. Patients can respond
      to disease specific questions in spencer. Spencer certified pharmacists have the ability to
      review patient responses remotely and determine the need for reassessment, medication
      reconciliation and clinical intervention as appropriate. Spencer permits intervention
      remotely through Telehealth capabilities and consultation. Patient receives appointment time
      directly from spencer, spencer automatically rings at designated time, and call is initiated
      when patient answers with the touch of a screen. Daily tracking of medication adherence and
      response to relevant clinical engagement questions will be conducted via the spencer
      platform.

      Through the connected devices, spencer ensures that everyone in the circle of care can
      participate in the wellbeing of the patient. Spencer Assist is a mobile app that allows
      caregivers and family members to support patients at home. Medication adherence data is also
      accessible to the health care team. The pharmacist, health care provider and caregiver are
      now electronically connected to patients and can access data regarding deviations in
      adherence in real time. This connectivity allows for earlier intervention to provide the
      support needed for improved healthcare outcomes.

      The spencer system empowers patients to manage their treatment regimen and schedule from the
      comfort of their own home. Spencer technology addresses key priority areas related to Aging
      in place, independence, and caregiver support and care coordination with care team and
      caregivers.

      Primary outcome: The study will look at patient focused outcome and seek to understand the
      influence of the medication dispensing device on medication adherence. Specifically,
      increased patient medication adherence in the intervention group as a result of spencer
      utilization. In the intervention group, the medication adherence data will be retrieved from
      the Catalyst spencer medication adherence platform. In the control group, the medication
      adherence will be will be self-reported and participants will be required to maintain missed
      dosage logs. Participants will complete self-reported adherence questionnaire in both groups
      (intervention and control) at baseline assessment and end of the study for comparison
      purposes.

      Catalyst Healthcare defines Adherence percent as actual pill (s) dispensed from the spencer
      at the prescribed time within a two hour time window. Average medication adherence will be
      calculated by an average of all ""pill level"" adherence numbers i.e. if all pills were taken
      within the window, the adherence number would only contain 100 values. Alternately if no
      pills were taken within the window, the adherence number would only contain 0 values.
      Adherence number for a patient within the time range then divided by the total number of
      pills will provide average medication adherence. Similar approach will be used for
      calculating medication adherence for control group participants.

      Data source and variables: the investigators will use data from multiple sources: Catalyst
      technology platform for adherence; determine baseline health status of the participants and
      characteristics by doing initial assessment upon enrollment; and a monthly follow-up survey
      will be completed to collect medication management data and record any changes in health
      status or healthcare needs

      Data analysis: Data will be entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to compare
      the baseline status of the intervention and control group as well as at the end of the
      intervention period. A Chi-square test of independence will be used for categorical variables
      such as the number of participants who missed one or more medication dosage in each group. An
      independent sample t-test will be performed for continuous variables such as to compare the
      average number of missed medicines between the intervention and control group. Any
      confounding factors will be controlled in the regression model. Statistical tests for
      inferential statistics will be set at 95% confidence level.

      The aim of this study is to assess the changes in the dietary habits of adults spending most
      of their time in their homes due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Eating habits of
      individuals may vary greatly depending on several factors such as geographic location,
      socioeconomic conditions, education level, knowledge about nutrition and psychological
      factors. Since this period of quarantine is economically and psychologically stressful, we
      hypothesise that individuals may alter their usual eating habits.
    ",,,,,,,,31-May-20,Actual,,"
      Since the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the latest Coronavirus outbreak as a
      'pandemic', most countries had to take strict measures such as travel bans and lock-downs to
      prevent the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, this unexpected situation has caused many
      people around to globe to panic buy and stock up on food for an unpredictable period of time
      as it cannot be estimated when the outbreak will be controlled.

      Nutrition plays an important role in our everyday life; it makes up a large part of a healthy
      life, it brings individuals together to socialise around a table and sometimes it can be used
      in times of stress as a coping mechanism leading to emotional eating.

      In this study it is hypothesised that adults may tempt to change their everyday eating habits
      due to social isolation. Humans are generally sociable beings and this period of social
      isolation will psychologically pressurise humans and may cause some of them to eat more in
      quantity or frequency as a mechanism to cope with the growing fear and anxiety. On the other
      hand, it is also hypothesised that, some individuals may prefer healthier ways of eating,

      can improve their immunity they will be less likely to contract the virus. The study may also
      show that some individuals will be highly impacted economically and this will alter their
      dietary preferences.

      Within the scope of this study an online survey consisting of 20 questions will be asked to
      volunteers who are over the age of 18 and spend most of their time at home in social
      isolation because of the Coronavirus outbreak. The survey does not include any personal
      questions but only general demographic data including gender, age range, the country they are
      currently residing, quarantine duration and whether or not they have observed any changes in
      their eating patterns since the beginning of this period.

      In some questions, observed changes, if any, are further investigated to include details such
      as increase/decrease in portion size, frequency of meals etc.

      The anterior nuclei of the thalamus in addition to periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral
      ventromedial medulla (RVM) are integral regions of a supraspinal opioidergic structure that
      regulate pain perception. With the capability to influence deep neurological tissues, low
      intensity frequency ultrasound pulsation (LIFUP) can likely modulate this circuit and induce
      analgesia. LIFUP deep brain modulation is achieved by induction of focused mechanical
      waveforms that traverse the cranium and underlying brain tissue. The low frequency of the
      ultrasonic wave consequently alters neuronal transmission and causes action potential
      variations through mechanical means, rather than thermal.

      The purpose of this study is to examine whether stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the
      thalamus via LIFUP induces analgesia. We hypothesize that suppression of the anterior nuclei
      of the thalamus will induce a temporary increase in pain tolerance. Moreover, the behavioral
      changes in pain will correlate with specific regional BOLD changes during pain.

      LIFUP uses a single large concave, or multiple ultrasound transducers in a cap placed on the
      scalp to produce high frequency (100Hz) sonications for 30 seconds at a time for 10 trains of
      pulses. Unlike traditional diagnostic ultrasound, which constantly transmits ultrasound and
      'listens' to the echo to form an image, LIFUP delivers the ultrasound in packets or pulses.
      For reasons that are not clear, pulsed ultrasound causes neurons to depolarize and fire.
      Bones typically block ultrasound waves. Cleverly, however, one can deliver the ultrasound
      from multiple sources and use the skull as a lens, to actually shape and focus the convergent
      beam deeper in the brain.

      The clinical use of LIFUP thus uses MRI scans taken before stimulation to position and
      calculate how multiple ultrasonic pulsations will converge at a location in the brain (taking
      into account the bone dispersion of the beam from the skull). Since a small transducer like
      in diagnostic ultrasound cannot individually cause neuronal discharge, with LIFUP neuronal
      firing can be focused both deep (2-12cm under the cap; for comparison, traditional TMS can
      stimulate 1-3.4cm2 deep(9, 10)) and focally (as small as 0.5mm in diameter, and up to 1000mm;
      the facility of a standard, commercially-available 70mm figure-of-8 TMS coil is roughly
      50mm2; (9, 10)). Interestingly, the pulse width of the carrying frequency of LIFUP (0.5ms) is
      strikingly similar to that used in all other pulsed neuromodulation therapies (DBS: 0.6ms,
      ECT: 0.5ms; TMS: 0.2ms; VNS: 0.5ms), suggesting that this timeframe is mechanistically
      meaningful. This is a good example of the common background science of brain stimulation that
      transcends the individual methods.

      Researchers have examined the effects of LIFUP in preclinical and clinical settings,
      confirming its ability to safely stimulate neural tissue(11-14), proposing cellular
      mechanisms for its efficacy(13-19), and now using LIFUP in human patients(20). Monti et al.
      (2016) described a case study in which they used LIFUP to stimulate a comatose patient's
      thalamus.(20). Two pre-LIFUP assessments rated the patient as being in minimally conscious
      state (MCS). After sonication, the patient recovered motor and oromotor functions the next
      day, advancing to full language comprehension and communication by nodding and shaking his
      head. Five days post-LIFUP, the patient attempted to walk. While this study was neither
      blinded nor sham-controlled, the first application of therapeutic LIFUP in a human patient
      was encouraging and we expect more therapeutic applications of LIFUP and potential clinical
      trials in the future. If LIFUP continues to show clinical potential, it has the potential to
      supplant the role of DBS without the need for surgery. The key barrier to LIFUP replacing DBS
      for clinical applications is that by and large, DBS is used in a manner where the device is
      inserted and turned constantly on without attempting to fundamentally change circuit dynamics
      or behavior so that you could remove the device. Obviously, patients cannot permanently wear
      a LIFUP helmet. However, to the degree that we learn how to stimulate in ways that
      permanently change circuit behavior (LTD or LTP) without ablation, we may be able to
      substitute several sessions of LIFUP that can train and rewire the brain instead of
      permanently implanting hardware. LIFUP can certainly stimulate deep and focal and
      noninvasively and thus may be a key next step in the field of brain stimulation.

      Information on the intervention to be studied. We will be using the Brainsonix Low intensity
      focused ultrasound pulsation device. (BX Pulsar 1001). Please see the manufacturers

      The investigators will use existing data from two US longitudinal birth cohorts that tracked
      mother-child dyads from pregnancy to adolescence: 1) Project Viva (1999-present) that
      enrolled 2,341 pregnancies and followed 2,128 children at delivery, 6 months, then yearly
      from 1 year to 15 years of child age, and 2) the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II,
      2005-2007) that enrolled 3,033 pregnancies with surveys in late pregnancy, neonatal (1
      month), then monthly from 2 months (N=2,552) to 12 months of infant age, and at 6 years. For
      Aim 1, the investigators will classify infants based on their age of egg introduction: never,
      <2 months, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, 6-8 months, 9-11 months, and 12 months. The investigators
      will compare physical growth, obesity, cardio-metabolic health, food allergy, and cognition
      test scores in mid-childhood and adolescence. The investigators will fit multi-variable
      linear or logistic regression models with fractional polynomial functions of the infant age
      of egg introduction. Both linear (e.g., earlier introduction, a higher probability of the
      outcome) and non-linear (e.g., threshold effect) associations will be tested. For Aim 2, The
      investigators will classify infants based on their frequency of egg intake: never,
      <once/week, once/week, 2-4 times/week, nearly daily or daily, and 2 times/day. The
      investigators will use similar analytic methods mentioned above to compare their later
      outcomes. Finally, the investigators will create an average probability of multiple child
      outcomes to balance across different aspects of child health and development. The
      investigators will identify the lowest-risk infant egg consumption when the corresponding
      average predicted probability of the related adverse outcomes is the lowest.

      The study proposes to conduct an open-label Phase II trial to evaluate the feasibility,
      safety and early efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) administration in reduction of
      transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and development
      of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in high-risk, healthy acute care provider
      participants exposed, directly or indirectly, to COVID-19 patients. There is a more than 50
      years track record of safety of HCQ for treatment and prevention of various disease states.

      Given the lack of data regarding use of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention in healthy participants
      in midst of pandemic crisis, this study proposes an expedited feasibility study focusing on
      safety and early efficacy.

      Prior to HCQ administration, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and other baseline biomarker testing will be
      conducted. During the 4-week study period, participants will be monitored for drug related
      adverse events and assessed for development of COVID. SARS-CoV-2 assay and biomarker testing
      will be repeated at the end of four-week study. Safety outcomes will be assessed by the
      number of adverse events (AEs) and their severity; and early efficacy as the number of
      participants who tested positive at the end of the 4-week period comparing to data collected
      by occupational Health regarding the total number of high-risk healthcare workers that were
      tested positive during the same period and historical controls from known high risk infection
      rates. An exploratory analysis of inflammatory regulation and immunomodulatory markers by HCQ
      and its effect on possible disease modification based on previously studied
      pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19.

      The broader aim of this study is to set a precedent to facilitate a large-scale emergent
      public health intervention. Purpose would be to mitigate, or abort further transmission of
      COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 transmission has occurred prior to initiation of this study,
      the rationale for this intervention is based on prior epidemiological evidence.
      Post-infectious or vaccination-induced immunity in at least 30% of population at-risk has
      been shown to mitigate or abort propagation of a local epidemics and global pandemic. This
      would help flatten the curve of the disease progression, until such time that a vaccine may
      become available. Data from this study will be used to design and implement a
      population-based phase IIb/III randomized clinical trial.

      This study aims to assess whether virtual reality is an acceptable alternative to
      pharmacological sedation during colonoscopy. Past research has shown that in order to fully
      experience pain, one must pay attention to it. Virtual reality has been shown to help
      mitigate pain by providing distraction from the painful stimulus.

      In this study, participants undergo screening or surveillance colonoscopy under virtual
      reality distraction.

      Individuals who are scheduled for a routine screening or surveillance colonoscopy and have
      had at least one prior colonoscopy under conscious sedation are eligible to participate.
      Those who give written, informed consent are fitted with and oriented to a virtual reality
      head-mounted display. The subject is then prepped for the colonoscopy by a registered nurse
      per institution protocol. This includes placement of an intravenous line.

      Written consent is obtained for colonoscopy with medication by the performing endoscopist.
      The patient is again fitted with the virtual reality head-mounted display and virtual
      experiences are initiated. The endoscopist performs the colonoscopy with the subject using
      virtual reality distraction instead of pharmacological sedation for as long as the subject
      likes. Standard sedatives and narcotics will be administered by a registered nurse upon
      participant request at any time during the procedure.

      Following the procedure, participants and endoscopists complete a questionnaire about their
      subjective experience with virtual reality during colonoscopy. The research coordinator fills
      out a case report form for each subject with information about the procedure including
      length, colonoscopy findings, and complications as noted by the endoscopist.

      Climate change not only affects the planet's natural resources, but also severely impacts
      human health. An individual's ability to adequately cope with short- or long-term increases
      in ambient temperature is critical for maintaining health and wellbeing. Prolonged increases
      in temperature (heatwaves) pose a serious health risk for older adults, who have a reduced
      capacity to efficiently regulate body temperature. However, information regarding the impact
      of age on body temperature regulation during prolonged exposure to extreme heat is lacking,
      as is research on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing heat strain in such
      situations. This project will address these important knowledge gaps by exposing healthy
      young and older adults to a prolonged (9 hour) heat exposure, with conditions representative
      of heatwaves in temperate continental climates. An additional cohort of older adults will
      complete the same heatwave simulation but will be briefly (2 hours) exposed to cooler
      conditions (22-23°C) mid-way through the session (akin to visiting a cooling centre or cooled
      location). The investigators will evaluate age-related differences in the capacity to
      dissipate heat via direct air calorimetry (a unique device that permits the precise
      measurement of the heat dissipated by the human body) and their effect on the regulation of
      body temperature. The investigators anticipate that older adults will exhibit progressive
      increases in the heat stored in the body throughout the simulated heatwave, resulting in
      progressive increases in body core temperature. Further, older adults exposed to brief-mid
      day cooling will rapidly gain heat upon re-exposure to high ambient temperatures. As a
      result, by the end of exposure body temperatures will be similar to the group not removed
      from the heat.

      OBJECTIVES Intervention 1: Evaluate the effect of age on whole-body heat storage, body core
      temperature, and the development of cardiovascular strain and acute inflammation during
      day-long (9 hours) exposure to simulated heatwave conditions.

      Intervention 2: Determine whether short-duration exposure (2 hours) to an air-conditioned
      environment following extreme heat exposure results in lasting reductions in physiological
      strain in older adults upon return to the heat.

      Hypotheses Intervention 1: Older adults will experience greater heat storage throughout the
      9-hour simulated heatwave compared to the younger participants. Consequently, body core
      temperature will be greater in the older adults and between-group differences will be
      exacerbated as exposure progresses. We will also explore the secondary hypothesis that
      differences in body temperature will be paralleled by greater alterations in cardiovascular
      variables and acute circulatory and intracellular inflammation in the older adults.

      Intervention 2: Body heat storage will be exacerbated in the older adults exposed to the
      cooling centre intervention upon return to the heat (hours 5-6) compared to the older adults
      from Intervention 1 who remained in the heat. Consequently, body core temperature will be
      comparable (statistically equivalent) between groups by the end of exposure.

      Methods Participants A total of 20 young (age: 18-31 years) and 40 older (age: 64-80 years)
      adults will be recruited for the proposed project, with an approximately even distribution of
      men and women in each intervention arm. Young (n = 20) and older (n = 20) adults will
      complete Intervention 1 and a separate cohort of older adults (n = 20) will complete
      Intervention 2. Participants will be homogenous for anthropomorphic characteristics as well
      as habitual physical activity levels as verified via standardized questionnaires.

      Experimental Design Pre-trial instructions All participants will be asked to avoid strenuous
      physical activity and alcohol for 24 hours prior to all preliminary and experimental sessions
      and to eat a light meal 2 hours before the start of each session. Participants will also be
      asked to consume a minimum of 500 ml of water the night before and morning of each session to
      ensure adequate hydration. Adequate hydration will be verified upon arrival to the laboratory
      (urine specific gravity <1.025). For all sessions, participants will wear athletic shorts
      (and a sport top for women).

      Preliminary screening All participants will complete one preliminary evaluation a minimum of
      7 days before the first experimental session. During this session they will be familiarized
      with all procedures and measurement techniques and will complete the Get Active Questionnaire
      (GAQ) and the American Heart Association Pre-participation screening Questionnaire to assess
      their eligibility to participate. The GAQ will also be used to assess habitual activity
      levels along with the Kohl Physical Activity Questionnaire. Participants will also provide
      verbal and written informed consent at this time. Body height and mass will be determined via
      a physician stadiometer and a high-performance weighing terminal, respectively, and from
      these measurements body surface area will be calculated.

      Experimental Protocol (Intervention 1) Each session will commence at 07:00-09:00. Upon
      arrival to the laboratory, the participant will provide a urine sample for the assessment of
      urine specific gravity, after which a measurement of nude body mass will be obtained.
      Participants will then insert a temperature probe for the continuous measurement of rectal
      temperature. Thereafter, participants will be instrumented for the measurement of skin
      temperature and 5-lead echocardiogram. Baseline cardiovascular parameters will be evaluated
      via a brief (~45 min) cardiovascular test battery, performed as follows. Brachial arterial
      systolic and diastolic pressures reconstructed from arterial pressure waveforms measured at
      the right middle finger (volume clamp technique) and 5-lead echocardiogram recordings will be
      collected for 10-min while the participant rests quietly (spontaneous breathing). Immediately
      thereafter, arterial systolic and diastolic pressures will be measured in triplicate via
      manual auscultation (~30 sec between measures), after which forearm and calf blood flows on
      the right side of the body will be measured via automated venous occlusion plethysmography.
      Throughout the test battery, the participant will be seated with both feet on the floor,
      except for during the measurements of limb blood flow, where the instrumented limbs will be
      elevated to facilitate venous drainage. Finally, a venous blood sample and body mass
      measurement will be obtained.

      Participants will then be transferred to the whole-body direct calorimeter chamber, regulated
      to 40°C and ~10-15% humidity. These conditions were chosen to simulate peak temperatures
      experienced during heatwaves and are similar to peak conditions in recent heatwaves in North
      America in 2018 (Ottawa, Ontario; 34°C and 58%, heat index: 41°C) and Europe in 2003 (Paris,
      France; 38°C and 25%, heat index: 38°C). The participant will rest quietly for 3-hours (hours
      1-3) within the calorimeter chamber while whole-body heat production and exchange are
      measured continuously. At the 3-hour mark, the participant will exit the calorimeter and the
      brief cardiovascular test battery will be performed again followed by a measurement of body
      mass. Hours 4-6 will be spent resting in the heat in the thermal chamber adjacent to the
      calorimeter. During this time, participants will be allowed to consume a light, self-provided
      lunch with low water content. Tap water will be provided ad libitum via a self-service
      insulated water cooler located in the thermal chamber. Another cardiovascular battery will
      then be performed followed by a measurement of body mass. The participant will then re-enter
      the calorimeter where the final 3 hours will be spent (hours 6-9). At the end of this period,
      the participants will undergo a fourth and final cardiovascular test battery and a final
      venous blood sample and body mass measurement will be procured.

      Statistical analysis and sample size calculations Primary and secondary variables will be
      evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. Time will be modelled as a repeated
      within-subject fixed effect, and age-group will be modelled as a between-subject fixed
      effect. Pre-heat exposure values of the outcome variable, participant sex, and self-reported
      weekly physical activity (min/week, as assessed via the GAQ) will be included as covariates.
      Participant identification will be modeled as a random effect in all analyses. Akaike's
      information criterion will be used to determine random effect and variance/covariance
      structures.

      Post hoc multiple comparisons will be made on model estimated marginal means. Given the small
      number of comparisons for each variable, multiplicity corrections will not be employed.
      Homoscedasticity will be evaluated for all models by visual assessment of residual plots.
      Approximate normal distribution of residuals will be assessed via visual inspection of
      histograms and Q-Q plots. Data will be log-transformed in the event that the distribution of
      residuals meaningfully deviates from normality. For all analyses, alpha will be set at 0.050.
      Descriptive statistics will be presented as means and standard deviations. Comparisons
      between groups and/or time-points will be presented as means and 95% confidence intervals
      [lower limit, upper limit].

      An a priori power analysis determined that a total sample size of 19 young and 19 older
      adults was required to detect a difference in the rate of whole-body heat storage between
      groups at the end of each calorimeter session (i.e., hours 3 and 9) with 80% statistical
      power. In lieu of clinically meaningful data (i.e., what would be considered a clinically
      meaningful change in whole-body heat storage), the standardized effect size (Cohen's d=1.06)
      was calculated based on the difference in the rate of whole-body heat storage between young
      and older adults over the final 30-min of a 3-hour heat exposure protocol (young: -2 [26]
      kJ/hour, older: 43 [54] kJ/hour) in our previous work.

      Experimental Protocol (Intervention 2) Experimental design The protocol for Intervention 2 is
      identical to that of Intervention 1 except that after the first calorimeter session and
      subsequent cardiovascular battery, participants will exit the thermal chamber and spend ~2
      hours (hours 5-6) resting in an air-conditioned room (~23°C, ~50% relative humidity). Similar
      to Intervention 1, participants will be allowed to eat a small self-provided lunch during
      this time and consume water (tap) ad libitum. The third cardiovascular battery will also be
      performed in the cooled environment. As in Intervention 1, participants will then re-enter
      the calorimeter for the final 3 hours, where they will rest in the heat for the remainder of
      the experimental session.

      Statistical analysis and sample size calculations Statistical analysis for Intervention 2
      will be performed to assess whether mid-day exposure to a cooled room results in greater body
      heat storage following exposure such that physiological responses are similar to those of the
      non-cooled group by the end of the 9-hour heatwave simulation. Cumulative whole-body heat
      storage will be evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model with experimental group modelled
      as a between-subject fixed effect. Cumulative heat storage over the first three hours of the
      9-hour exposure will be included as a covariate to account for the influence of any inter- or
      intra-individual factors (e.g., sex, physical activity levels), measured or unmeasured,
      impacting whole-body heat exchange and storage. Comparisons of heat storage between groups
      will be made using model estimated marginal means.

      Body core temperature, as estimated by rectal temperature (primary outcome), will be analyzed
      with a linear mixed effects model with experimental group (two levels: cooling and
      no-cooling) modelled as a between-subject fixed effect and time as a repeated within-subject
      fixed effect (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-hours post-cooling intervention). Like the model for heat
      storage, rectal temperature at the end of the first calorimetry session (i.e., hour 3 of the
      9-hour exposure) will be included as a covariate to account for the influence of any measured
      or unmeasured inter- or intra-individual factors impacting the body temperature responses to
      resting heat exposure.

      The effect of cooling on rectal temperature will then be assessed via two one-sided tests
      performed on the mixed-effects model derived estimated marginal means at each timepoint.
      Equivalence bounds will be set to ±0.3°C, which corresponds to the typical day-to-day
      variation of core temperature and has been suggested to reflect a meaningful/detectable
      change in body temperatures in a recent study assessing the influence of cooling strategies
      on physiological strain in young adults. Secondary variables will be similarly evaluated. The
      level of significance will be set at P < 0.050. Descriptive statistics will be presented as
      mean (standard deviation) and comparisons between groups will be presented as mean ± 95%
      confidence interval.

      An a priori power analysis determined that a total sample size of 18 older adults in each
      group (36 participants total) is required to confirm whether between-group differences in
      rectal temperature are equivalent within upper and lower bounds of +0.3°C and -0.3°C,
      respectively, with 80% power. This corresponds to an effect size (Cohen's d) of 1.0, based on
      the pooled-standard deviation of 0.3°C, determined from published data from our laboratory
      demonstrating a 0.2°C (SD 0.3) difference in core temperature between young and older adults
      and a 0.0°C (SD 0.3) difference in core temperature between older adults with and without
      type 2 diabetes following 3 hours of rest in a hot environment.

      The specific hypothesis is that the consumption of 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing

      The specific hypothesis is that the consumption of 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing
      actinidin protease) prior to 100g of ground beef will increase the rate of protein digestion
      from the beef in the elderly, leading to an increased uptake of the essential amino acids.
      Furthermore, this increased essential amino acid availability will produce a greater
      postprandial net anabolic protein response, as well as increased fractional synthetic rates
      of muscle proteins.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use a double-blinded crossover design
      involving two intervention arms; in both arms 100g of ground beef (cooked weight) will be
      consumed following either 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing actinidin protease) or 2
      Hort16A Gold kiwifruit (devoid of actinidin protease) by elderly subjects.

      Changhua Christian Hospital,Taiwan

      Aim of the study: To investigate the effect of medical acupuncture in comparison to placebo
      acupuncture by heart rate variability(HRV)

      Design: Prospective randomized trial

      Intervention: Experiment group using indwelling fixed needles, N=56 ; Control group using
      placebo needles, N=56

      Outcome measures: International RLS Rating Scale, HRV
    ",,,,,,,,31-Dec-20,Actual,,"
      RLS occurs in 3-15% of the general population and in 10-30% of patients on maintenance
      dialysis. End-stage renal disease, a decrease in HRV is typically found, with abnormal HRV
      being considered an independent risk factor for mortality.While the majority of studies show
      an initial improvement in symptoms, longer studies and clinical experience show that either
      treatment efficacy decreases with time, and/or augmentation develops: dopaminergic
      augmentation has been reported to be the main reason for treatment discontinuation and
      treatment failure in RLS/WED.

      The study randomly assigned to either true acupuncture treatment or placebo/sham acupuncture
      treatment. Each participant will undergo 8 treatments twice-weekly, for a period of 4 weeks.
      At the end of the eighth treatment session, each participant will again fill out a IRLSRS
      questionnaire and HRV test.Then following a 4-week washout period, patients will be crossed
      over to either placebo/sham or true acupuncture treatment, again 8 twice-weekly treatments,
      for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of the second treatment regimen all participants will
      again fill out a IRLSRS questionnaire and HRV test.

      A novel type of non-cigarette tobacco product was recently approved for sale in the US, the
      heated tobacco product (HTP) IQOS. IQOS may be less harmful than cigarettes, and there are
      some reports that it may produce more rewarding subjective effects compared to e-cigarettes.
      The approval of IQOS provides a unique opportunity to gather preliminary data surrounding
      IQOS. The goal of this pilot study is to assess the subjective effects and relative
      reinforcement value of IQOS, including its downstream effects on cigarette smoking. Current
      smokers will complete a one-week baseline period where they smoke as normal before attending
      an in-person lab visit. During the in-person lab visit, participants (n=10) will sample a
      traditional cigarette and a novel IQOS tobacco product. Participants will answer
      questionnaires about each product they sample and then complete a preference assessment in
      which they choose between the IQOS and their own cigarette. Finally, participants will take
      home a tobacco product they sampled to use ad libitum (1-week sampling). During the at-home
      baseline and sampling weeks, participants will complete electronic daily diaries cataloging
      their tobacco use. Biomarkers (i.e., expired carbon monoxide, cotinine) will corroborate
      self-reported indices of use.

      Central sensitization is a condition that represents a cascade of neurological adaptations,
      resulting in an amplification of nociceptive responses from noxious and non-noxious stimuli.
      This phenomenon presents itself in a vast majority of chronic pain syndromes. Previous
      evidence has shown that central sensitization results in afferent nociceptor and dorsal horn
      abnormalities; however, a link between whether this abnormality translates into motor output
      and more specifically, ventral horn abnormalities, needs to be further explored. Twenty
      participants were recruited and either a topical capsaicin or a placebo topical cream was
      applied to their back to induce a transient state of sensitization. Surface
      electromyography(sEMG) and intramuscular electromyography(iEMG) were used to record motor
      unit activity from the trapezius and infraspinatus muscles before and after application of
      capsaicin/placebo. Motor unit recruitment and variability were analyzed in the sEMG and iEMG
      respectively
    ",,,,,,,,10-Mar-20,Actual,"[""Motor Disorders""]","
      Central sensitization describes a state of neuronal hyper-excitability in the central nervous
      system that may occur due to malfunction of spinal and supraspinal pain facilitatory and
      inhibitory circuits resulting in amplification of somatosensorial responses. Beyond
      somatosensorial changes, alteration in motor function can also be present with pain, and may
      be a reflex of neuromuscular function impairment. A normal afferent input and normal central
      processing circuitry is essential to deliver normal efferent output. However, the influence
      of the changes that occur within the dorsal horn on the ventral horn remain largely ill
      defined.

      Motor unit assessment is crucial in evaluating diseases and abnormalities within the ventral
      horn. Activity of the ventral horn, where anterior horn cells reside, is very important for
      motor unit activation. Surface EMG (sEMG) and intramuscular EMG (iEMG) can be used to assess
      the neural drive to muscles, by recording motor units to understand the effects of central
      sensitization on motor control and the ventral horn. Based on Henneman's size principle,
      motor units should be recruited in the same order, with smaller units being recruited first.
      This principle presents an opportunity to investigate if central sensitization creates
      abnormalities on the motor unit level.

      Previously, central sensitization has been induced in healthy subjects to examine its
      neurophysiological effects via capsaicin. Capsaicin, a chilli pepper extract, can be used to
      effectively induce experimental transient states of central sensitization. The presence of
      expanded sensorial responses and the involvement of the spinal nociceptive system post
      capsaicin have been largely tested by means of quantitative sensory testing methods and
      electromyography (EMG).

      Despite the usefulness of experimental capsaicin to better understand the sensorial
      abnormalities, its impact on motor function and motor unit recruitment are lesser studied.
      Evidence suggests that nociceptive input by peripheral capsaicin exerts a centrally-mediated
      inhibitory effect on motor function. A decrease in root mean squared (RMS) amplitude during
      exercise at the time of peak sensitization was measured by needle EMG. However, the effect
      that capsaicin-induced sensitization has on individual motor units or on their recruitment
      patterns has not been previously examined.

      The purpose of this study was to determine whether topical capsaicin-induced sensitization
      has any influence on ventral horn activity. We hypothesize that capsaicin induces a change in
      individual motor unit activity, as well as the recruitment pattern of many motor units, and
      may affect motor unit activity at different segmental levels from the level of capsaicin
      application.

      Participants:

      Twenty-three healthy participants, age between 20-70 years old, with no direct trauma to
      cervicothoracic region within the past 30 days, no past medical history of inflammatory
      disorders as rheumatoid arthritis, no neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease
      nor motor neurone diseases as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or other neuromuscular disorder
      were recruited for this study. Also, included subjects had a normal body mass index (18.5 -
      24.9) and had a pain visual analogue scale (VAS) below 3 indicating low pain severity. Since
      prevalence of neck pain in the general population is high, mild pain or aches are not
      necessarily related to an abnormality of the underlying muscle. Participants had to be able
      to communicate in English. Participants were excluded if they had persistent pain for more
      than 3 months.

      Experimental Protocol:

      An initial screening was performed to assess eligibility in the study. Each participant was
      seated upright with their hands comfortably on their lap and asked to relax their neck and
      shoulder muscles. The physician member of the research team then assessed the patients' pain
      intensity by visual analogue scale (VAS). VAS ranges from 0 to 100 mm which 0 mm reflecting
      no pain at all and 100 mm representing the worst imaginable pain. Following this, brush
      allodynia, a clinical technique used to identify pain due to a stimulus that does not
      normally provoke pain, was performed to confirm presence of central sensitization. To map out
      borders of secondary allodynia, subjects were instructed to recognize a distinct alteration
      in the sensation perception such as increased burning, intense pricking, or an unpleasant
      sensation, and that location was marked. Brush allodynia score (BAS) was calculated as the
      distance between the farthest points marked on the superior and inferior axis multiplied by
      the distance between the farthest points marked on the medial and lateral axis as previously
      described by Cavallone et. al. The VAS and the presence of central sensitization by means of
      BAS were assessed at baseline (pre) before the induction of sensitization and twenty minutes
      after (post).

      Upon successful screening of inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants had their left
      side area of skin (overlying the upper trapezius and infraspinatus muscles) cleansed with
      alcohol preparation pads and water. The skin was abraded with '3M Red Dot' abrasive strips
      before application of the surface electromyogram (Trigno Galileo sensors, Delsys Inc.).
      Electrodes were placed in 4 areas: the muscle belly of the upper trapezius, and the
      infraspinatus, as well as reference electrodes on C7 and the acromion. These electrodes were
      4 channel EMG sensors and had their signals filtered from 20 - 450 Hz. The sEMG recordings
      were wirelessly transmitted to the Trigno base station, which relays and compiles the data to
      Neuromap (Delsys Inc.) for signal analysis. A monopolar needle electrode was inserted into
      the upper fibers of trapezius muscle and its reference was placed at the mid-clavicle point.
      Using this setup intramuscular recordings of single motor units were performed using an
      Excaliber, Natus Medical clinical electrodiagnostic machine.

      Electromyograms recordings before application of intervention

      Participants were instructed to perform horizontal shoulder abductions from 0° to 90° and
      then from 90° to 0° for 1 minute. The study subject was verbally cued to move their arm every
      2 seconds. sEMGs were recorded during this time. Upon completion of this task, a monopolar
      intramuscular needle electrode was placed directly into the upper trapezius muscle.
      Participants were then instructed to gently contract their trapezius muscle by shrugging
      their shoulder, enough to recruit only the first motor unit in that region. Visual feedback
      of the signal was given to the subject to ensure that only the first motor unit was activated
      for the movement. The signal from this motor unit was then optimized for initial deflection
      from baseline and amplitude characteristics before recordings were made. iEMG recordings were
      recorded for 30 seconds at a sampling frequency of 6 kHz.

      Application of intervention

      Participants received either a dose of 2.5 ml (75µg/ml) capsaicin cream (treatment, Zostrix
      brand) or skin lotion (placebo) which was inert and caused no sensitization effects.
      Participants were also blinded to the delivered treatment, using concealed containers for the
      creams. The location of application was a 10 cm by 10 cm square on trapezius muscle which
      extended from T3 to T8 on the left side that all recordings were conducted.

      After collection of the baseline sEMG and iEMG recordings, a trained medical professional
      applied the capsaicin / placebo cream directly to the region of skin in a standardized 10 cm
      x 10 cm square at the spinal levels T3-T8, to sensitize the nociceptive afferents within that
      region. A twenty-minute waiting period was used to enable the sensitizing effects of
      capsaicin to take effect.

      Electromyograms recordings after application of intervention

      To confirm the presence of central sensitization, brush allodynia was used to detect
      mechanical allodynia outside the region of the primary nociception - region of topical
      placement - which is the region of secondary allodynia. Upon confirmation of central
      sensitization, in participants with application of topical capsaicin, participants were
      entered into the experimental arm of the study.

      Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF), are methods
      used to treat infertility, which affects approximately 10% reproductive aged women.
      Physicians at the Women's Institute perform over 300 embryo transfer procedures every year.
      Despite advances and improvements in ART over the past three decades, clinical pregnancy rate
      and live birth rate remain 30-40% and 20-30%. Implantation is essential for successful ART
      and IVF procedures, and many interventions have been studied to possibly improve implantation
      rates and thus pregnancy and live birth rates.

      Endometrial activation is one such intervention, sometimes referred to as endometrial
      ""activation"" or ""scratch,"" and it is defined as ""intentional endometrial injury, such as
      endometrial biopsy or curettage, in women undergoing ART"".

      A previous study found that implantation rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and live birth
      rates were more than twofold higher in women who underwent endometrial biopsy in the cycle
      before subsequent IVF treatment. Another study which examines endometrial activation prior to
      IVF similarly has concluded that endometrial activation prior to the embryo transfer cycle
      significantly improves clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates in women undergoing ART.
      Although the type of endometrial procedure is not specified, the timing activation was found
      be most effective when performed in the cycle prior to the embryo transfer.

      The mechanism of increase endometrial receptivity is still unknown; however three proposed
      hypothesis exist. The first hypothesis proposes that local activation of the endometrium
      induces endometrial decidualization which increases the probability of embryo implantation.
      The second hypothesis is that endometrial healing following endometrial activation increases
      secreted cytokines, interleukins, growth factors, macrophages, and dendritic cells which are
      beneficial to embryo implantation. The final hypothesis suggests that endometrial maturation
      is abnormally advanced during ovarian stimulation, so endometrial activation may lead to
      better synchronicity between the endometrium and the embryo..

      Endometrial activation has been found to have clear benefit in pregnancy and live birth rates
      in a previous study, however no uniform technique has been determined. The objective of this
      study is to compare two types of endometrial disruption - a vigorous endometrial biopsy with
      a Pipelle curette and a four quadrant endometrial ""scratch"" using a Shepard insemination
      catheter - to determine if the live birth rates are equivalent for the two methods. The
      investigators also will compare pain with the two types of endometrial activation. By
      comparing two distinct types of endometrial activation, the goal is to determine which method
      is both effective and tolerable to patients.

      The Shepherd catheter is a 1.8 mm malleable insemination catheter that can be curved to
      traverse the cervix. It is also used by some physicians in the Women's Institute to perform
      saline infusion sonography. When the catheter is inserted under ultrasound guidance, it is
      often placed in the subendometrial tissue, and causes deflection and disruption of the
      endometrium but is tolerated well. The Pipelle is a 3.1 mm semi-rigid catheter with an
      internal stylet plunger. A biopsy is performed by placing the catheter into the uterus,
      withdrawing the stylet to create suction, and aspirating endometrial tissue into the
      catheter.

      A study done by Leclair et al. found that the mean pain that women had when the Pipelle was
      used for an endometrial biopsy was 6.2±2.4 on a visual analog scale from 1-10 (5). Pain with
      the Shepard catheter has not been studied when it is used for endometrial biopsy.

      Indonesian Hajj Health Officers have the responsibility and very important role in providing
      health services for Indonesian pilgrims during embarkation and debarkation. One of the main
      indicators of success is they have excellent physical fitness. This study aims to determine
      the effectiveness of an intervention program by comparing the results of (intervention)
      intervention groups, namely the effect of physical exercise interventions (endurance
      exercise) measured before and after the intervention. This research is an intervention study,
      and I understand that the process of taking blood can occur with fear, pain due to being
      pricked by a needle, can faint or be infected. However, previous blood pressure tests,
      sterile collection techniques and performed by experts, are very unlikely to cause side
      effects.
    ",,,,,,,,8-Oct-19,Actual,,"
      The investigators invite all Indonesian Hajj Health Officers candidates to participate in
      research on physical fitness (VO2max) which is an important part of providing Hajj health
      services in Saudi Arabia while they are on duty. I was involved in the RT-PCR examination and
      physical fitness test (VO2max) that was carried out before the intervention program and was
      briefed on the examination protocol before being tested. The consent form was given to me
      first to be handled. I was informed about the intervention process and the purpose of the
      research, as well as the confidentiality of the data, collected. And it was also stated that
      I would be allowed to withdraw from the research at any time without pressure and coercion
      from any party. The procedure investigators will do is take samples from prospective
      Indonesian Hajj Health Officers undergoing a series of anamneses and physical examinations by
      doctors, in the form of personal data, physical activities, general physical examinations
      including TB, BB, HR, RR, then performed the physical activity eligibility forms. Next, a 1
      ml blood sample is taken into a purple test tube containing EDTA to prevent lysis. The blood
      sample is taken to the HUM-RC Makassar Biomolecular Biology laboratory and stored in a frozen
      cupboard, after which an initial physical fitness measurement (VO2max) test is carried out
      using the Multi Fitness Test (MFT) or Bleep Test to PRE TEST at the Health Training Center
      (Health Training Center) BBPK) Makassar, followed by running exercises intervention as far as
      1600 meters 3 times a week duration of 20-30 each training session with a frequency of
      exercise 16 times 5 weeks according to a predetermined schedule, then conducted a physical
      fitness test (VO2max) using the same method when PRE TEST to POST TEST I, followed by 1 ml
      blood sampling at Sudiang Embarkation Hajj Makassar, then 1 week later physical fitness test
      (VO2max) to POST TEST II without blood sampling is taken again.

      Participants (n = 30), measured physical fitness level (VO2max) using the Multistage Fitness
      Test (MFT) Bleep Test (level and feedback) method before being given intervention
      (pre-exercise), after that given a running intervention 1600 meters duration 20 -30 minutes
      each training session 3 times a week with a frequency of exercise16 times for 5 weeks, then
      physical fitness measurements (VO2max) → (post-exercise 1), then intermittent 1-week duration
      of physical fitness measurements (VO2max) again without intervention and blood sampling
      (post-exercise 2).

      Participants only joined in one group will be given intervention for 5 weeks in the form of
      running 1600 meters duration of 20-30 minutes 3 times a week. It is important for the
      participants as well as for us to know which training methods are given. this information
      will be documented in our file, but the investigators will not see these files until after
      the research is complete. this is the best way the investigators have for testing without
      being influenced by what the investigators think or expect might happen.

      The doctor in charge of research will always look after the participants very carefully
      during the study. If the investigators are worried about what is done, the investigators will
      find out how the level of physical fitness that participants get and make changes. If there
      is something the participant is worried about or is disturbing the Participant about the
      research, please talk to me or one of the other researchers.

      In this study, the investigators did not use a placebo term, but the investigators still
      explained to participants in the world of research that the term placebo is known as clinical
      trials or interventions given to participants that are not genuine but fake. For good
      research, participants mustn't know whether the participants have been properly measured
      according to the criteria or not. This is one of the best ways the investigators have to find
      out what level of physical fitness the investigators are testing. No side effects might occur
      because the previous sample was very rigorously selected through analysis, physical
      examination and physical activity feasibility testing. If Participants find that Our
      interventions are very uncomfortable for participants, the investigators can use other
      exercise options more comfortably according to the available exercise choices.

      The possibility of danger, risk, or side effects in this study is very small because the
      selection of samples is done very closely starting with anamnesis and head-to-toe physical
      examination and continued with a physical activity feasibility test (PAR-Q). If the physical
      fitness test occurs when there is suffocation, the researcher has prepared 2 medical staff
      who accompanied the subjects during the physical fitness test and also in this study the
      investigators prepared 2 clinics namely the Makassar BBPK Health Clinic which was used during
      the physical fitness pre-test and the Clinic Musytasyfa Health Makassar Haji Sudiang
      Dormitory that was used at the time of physical fitness post-test.

      During the study, the investigators carried out a series of research processes as follows:
      Pre-exercise

        -  In the first stage: Conducting anamneses and physical examinations by doctors, in the
           form of personal data, physical activity, general physical examination including Height,
           Weight, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure (BP)

        -  In the second stage: Completion of physical activity eligibility forms.

        -  In the third step: a 1 ml blood sample is taken into a purple test tube containing EDTA
           to prevent lysis. The blood samples were taken to the Makassar HUM-RC Biomolecular
           Biology laboratory and stored in a frozen cupboard.

        -  In the fourth step: Measurement of the initial physical fitness test (VO2max) using the
           Multi Fitness Test (MFT) or Bleep Test to PRE TEST at the Makassar Health Training
           Center (BBPK) Endurance Exercise

        -  In the first stage: Selecting an exercise schedule according to the provisions of the
           study

        -  In the second stage: Exercise choice I: Monday-Wednesday-Friday; Exercise choice II:
           Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday; Exercise choice III: Wednesday-Friday-Sunday

        -  In the third stage: Document endurance exercises in the form of a video exercise Post
           Exercise I

        -  In the first stage: Initial physical fitness test (VO2max) measurement using the Multi
           Fitness Test (MFT) or Bleep Test to POST TEST I at the Haji Sudiang Makassar Dormitory
           In the second stage: Recovery 1 hour after the physical fitness test In the third stage:
           Taking 1 ml of blood sample inserted in a purple test tube containing EDTA to prevent

      The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the effectiveness of the addition of a
      single-session child sexual abuse (CSA) prevention module (Smart Parents - Safe and Healthy
      Kids) on improving parents' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding CSA prevention for
      parents already receiving parent-education services. The investigators hypothesize that
      parents who receive the parenting curriculum and the CSA prevention module will (a)
      demonstrate significant improvement in CSA-related awareness (i.e., knowledge, attitudes) and
      protective behaviors from pre-test to post-test, and (b) demonstrate higher scores on
      CSA-related awareness and protective behaviors as compared to parents who only receive the

      The aim of the present study was to compare the treatment efficacy of single puncture
      arthrocentesis (SPA) and double puncture arthrocentesis (DPA) techniques in Temporomandibular
      joint (TMJ) disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR).
    ",,,,,,,,1-Dec-19,Actual,,"
      Study sample consisted of 36 patients with DDwoR. 18 patients received SPA procedure and
      included in SPA group. The other 18 patients received DPA procedure and included in DPA
      group.

      Double puncture arthrocentesis technique:

      Posterior puncture method was used as described by Alkan and Etoz. for DPA. A straight line
      was drawn with a marker pen along the skin from the middle portion of the auricular tragus to
      the lateral chantus. The first puncture point was marked 10 mm anterior and 2 mm inferior to
      the tragus and the second 7 mm anterior and 2 mm inferior to the tragus. After local
      anesthesia, upper joint cavity was irrigated with 200 mL of Lactated Ringer's (RL) solution
      by inserting two 21- gauge needle. At the end of the procedure, after withdrawn of one of the
      needles, 1 mL of sodium hyaluronate (SH) was injected into the upper TMJ compartment through
      the other needle.

      Single Puncture Arthrocentesis Technique:

      SPA was performed with one needle (SPA Type-1 according to Senturk and Cambazoglu). The first
      reference point in DPA was used as the needle entry point fort he SPA. With this technique,
      the inflow and outflow of solution were provided through the same cannula and lumen of one
      21-gauge needle as described by Guarda-Nardini et al. The joint was irrigated with 200 mL of
      RL solution under high pressure. At the end of the procedure1 mL of SH was injected through
      the needle.

      The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an international shortage of the nasopharyngeal (NP)
      swabs used to collect sample for virological testing. This shortage has become a crisis as
      testing capacity is growing, and threatens to become the bottleneck at University of Virginia
      Health System and in the Commonwealth of Virginia, as it already is in other testing centers.
      To resolve this crisis, a team in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories at University of
      Virginia Medical Center has been working closely with biomedical engineers in the University
      of Virginia (UVA), School of Engineering and with high volume domestic manufacturers
      developing injection molded polypropylene flocked nylon NP swab.

      This prototype will be tested for non-inferiority relative to existing, already validated NP
      swabs (""control swab"") for purposes of molecular microbiology: i.e. the polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) tests used for virological testing for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the
      nasopharynx of patients with Covid-19 and patients under investigation (PUI) for Covid-19,
      the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, will be swabbed using a prototype swab and a control swab
      (the standard of care swab), and test for concordance of SARS-CoV-2. In all cases the swab
      will be transported in validated FDA cleared viral transport medium (VTM) as per standard
      operating procedure at University of Virginia Medical Center.

      Recent data have shown that covid19 is disproportionately infecting and killing African
      Americans and Latinx people in the United States. The aim of the study is to determine which
      messages are most effective at increasing knowledge and changing behaviors that can protect
      individuals and their communities from the virus. To accomplish this aim, we plan to recruit
      approximately 20,000 Hispanic and African-American individuals and randomly assign them to
      videos that vary either the sender or the framing of the message, while providing the
      relevant public health information.

      The following procedures will be followed. The research subjects will participate online.

        1. Doctors from MGH who express interest in participating will record messages according to
           our scripts (US Doctors Script African American, US Doctors Script Latinx). They will be
           instructed to film several different versions each.

        2. We will recruit a sample of Latinx and African American study participants from across
           the country through Lucid, an online survey firm that has access to a large subject
           pool.

        3. Participants will first read a consent script and give us their informed consent (US
           Doctors Messaging Consent)

        4. Participants will then navigate through the following steps

             1. Brief demographics survey questions (US Doctors Messaging Survey)

             2. Videos 1 and 2: Introduction, Acknowledgement, Social Distancing (US Doctors Script
                African American, US Doctors Script Latinx). Individuals in the control group will
                not see videos.

             3. Beliefs survey questions (US Doctors Messaging Survey)

             4. Video 3: Masks (US Doctors Script African American, US Doctors Script Latinx).
                Again, individuals in the control group will not see a video here.

             5. Main outcomes survey (US Doctors Messaging Survey)

             6. Control group is shown a version of all 3 videos at end (US Doctors Script African
                American, US Doctors Script Latinx).

        5. The video messages each participant in one of the treatment groups sees will be
           randomized on the following dimensions. The different versions are clearly demarcated in
           the US Doctors Scripts document.

             1. Racial or ethnic identity of the doctor delivering the messages: concordant vs.
                discordant identity to the subject.

             2. Whether the message includes an acknowledgment of ""elephant in the room"" issues for
                each target group: trust in the medical system or fear of deportation.

             3. Whether the social distancing component of the message is delivered by Dr. Birx of
                the CDC or recorded by the MGH physicians.

             4. Whether individuals are given information about how representative individuals
                perceive mask wearers of color. This information comes from results of our
                nationally representative pilot survey.

             5. Some individuals in a control group will only see messages after all surveying has
                been completed.

      Background: The COVID-19 pandemic challenges the available hospital capacity, and this will
      be augmented by absenteeism of healthcare workers (HCW). HCW are at high risk, currently HCW
      constitute 20% of all the COVID-19 cases in Denmark. Strategies to prevent absenteeism of HCW
      are urgently needed.

      Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific
      effects against other infections; significant reductions in morbidity and mortality have been
      reported, and a plausible immunological mechanism has been identified.

      We hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW absenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Primary objective: To reduce absenteeism among HCW with direct patient contacts during the
      COVID-19 epidemic. Secondary objective: To reduce the number of HCW that are infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic and to reduce the number of hospital admissions
      amongst HCW with direct patient contacts during the COVID-19 epidemic.

      Study design: A multi-center randomized placebo controlled trial. Study population: 1500 HCW
      with direct patient contacts; defined as nurses, physicians and other medical staff working
      at emergency rooms and wards where COVID-infected patients are treated.

      Intervention: Participants will be randomized 1:1 to intradermal administration of a standard
      dose of BCG vaccine or placebo (saline).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: Number of days of (unplanned) absenteeism
      for any reason. Secondary endpoints: Number of days of (unplanned) absenteeism because of
      documented COVID infection. Cumulative incidence of hospital admissions.

      Risk for participants and impact: Based on previous experience and randomized controlled
      trials in adult and elderly individuals, the risks of BCG vaccination are considered low. The
      objective of this trial is to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of BCG vaccination
      through a lower work absenteeism rate of HCW and/or a mitigated clinical course of COVID
      infection.
    ",,,,,,,,1-Oct-21,Actual,"[""COVID-19""]","
      BACKGROUND Health-care workers face an elevated risk of exposure to - and infection with -
      SARS-CoV-2. It is imperative to ensure the safety, health and fitness of hospital personnel
      in order to safeguard continuous patient care. Strategies to prevent COVID-19 or to mitigate
      its clinical consequences are urgently needed.

      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but our group
      has shown that it can protect against death from other infections, it has what we have called
      non-specific effects (NSEs).[3] In clinical studies, BCG vaccination was associated with less
      child mortality, mainly as a result of reduced neonatal sepsis and respiratory infections. In
      a WHO-commissioned meta-analysis, BCG was associated with 42% (95%CI: 24-55%) lower child
      mortality.

      NSEs of BCG are not limited to children. An Indonesian trial has shown that consecutive BCG
      vaccination for 3 months reduced the incidence of acute upper tract respiratory infections by
      80% (95%CI=22-95%).

      It has been recently demonstrated that the non-specific beneficial effects of BCG vaccination
      are due to epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, a process termed
      'trained immunity'. E.g. among humans receiving yellow fever vaccine virus, those who had
      received BCG had - compared to placebo treated subjects - lower viral load, and improved
      anti-viral responses.

      We hypothesize that BCG vaccination may induce (partial) protection against susceptibility to
      and/or severity of COVID-19. This study will evaluate the efficacy of BCG to improve the
      clinical course of COVID-19 and to prevent absenteeism.

      Given the immediate threat of the COVID-19 epidemic the trial has been designed as a
      pragmatic study with a highly feasible primary endpoint, that can be continuously measured.
      We have therefore chosen unplanned absenteeism from work as primary outcome, in line with an
      ongoing clinical trial of BCG in the Netherlands.

      OBJECTIVES Primary objective: To reduce absenteeism among HCW with direct patient contacts
      during the COVID-19 epidemic. Secondary objective: To reduce the number of HCW that are
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic and to reduce the number of hospital
      admissions amongst HCW with direct patient contacts during the COVID-19 epidemic.

      HYPOTHESIS BCG vaccination of HCW will reduce absenteeism by 20% over a period of 6 months.

      METHODS

      Study design and follow-up:

      A multi-center randomized placebo-controlled trial.

      STUDY POPULATION As the COVID-19 epidemic has already started in Denmark, our intention is to
      start as soon as possible. Recruitment of study participants will take place at participating
      hospitals, at departments were COVID-19 patients are treated and, thus, the risk of exposure
      to SARS-CoV-2 is high.

      Participating hospitals Hospital PI Odense University Hospital Isik Somuncu Johansen Sygehus
      Lillebælt, Kolding Poul-Erik Kofoed Hvidovre Hospital Thomas Lars Benfield Nordsjællands
      Hospital Ellen Løkkegaard Aarhus University Hospital Christian Wejse Herning Hospital Lars
      Skov Dalgaard Sygehus Sønderjylland Christian B. Mogensen

      TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receiving one intradermal BCG
      vaccine or placebo. Participants that are randomized in the active arm will receive a BCG
      vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ Vaccines). Placebo will be 0.1 ml sterile 0.9 % NaCl, which has a
      similar color as the resuspended BCG vaccine.

      STUDY PROCEDURES Day 0: Participants fill in a short questionnaire regarding baseline
      characteristics. A blood sample will be drawn for subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2
      antibodies. Participants will be randomised to BCG or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation
      will be done centrally using the REDCap tool with stratification per hospital and by age
      groups (+/- 45 years of age) in blocks of 8.

      Participants will be blinded to treatment. The physicians administering the BCG vaccine or
      placebo will not be blinded. In case of serious adverse events, the participant can be
      unblinded after consultation with the coordinating PI or sponsor.

      The end of the trial is defined as whichever comes latest: the last patient's last
      registration in the online data collection, or 180 days.

      Day 0 till end of trial (weekly): Short electronic questionnaire regarding work absenteeism,
      symptoms and side effects through REDCap. In case a participant reports acute respiratory
      symptoms indicating COVID-19, he or she will be tested depending on test availability.

      End of trial: Participants are asked to fill in a final questionnaire. A blood sample will be
      drawn for subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All analyses will be performed from the intention-to-treat principle.
      The primary endpoint will be analysed as counts per week (i.e. multiple observations per
      subject) using a Bayesian negative binomial regression. Similar regression models will be
      used for secondary endpoints: Number of days of unplanned absenteeism because of documented
      COVID; number of days of self-reported fever. Documented COVID, death for any reason, death
      due to documented COVID, cumulative incidence of Intensive Care Admission for any reason,
      cumulative incidence of Intensive Care Admission due to documented COVID, cumulative
      incidence of Hospital Admission for any reason, cumulative incidence of Hospital Admission
      due to documented COVID will be analysed in Cox proportional hazards models.

      Participants will be followed until a new vaccine is given (but data will also be analyzed
      after receipt of a new vaccine type, to study potential interactions).

      When applicable (i.e. in the event that one or more participants have died during the
      follow-up period) a competing events analysis will be performed in addition.

      Interim analysis Every month, an interim analysis will be conducted by the independent
      statistician of the trial. The parallel Dutch trial will enable combined analysis that will
      strengthen the conclusions and increase the power to analyse the secondary outcomes and more
      rare outcomes as intensive hospitalization.

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study has ben approved by the Ethics Committee and by the Danish
      Medicines Agency.

      Participants will be recruited from the Des Moines University community and randomized into
      treatment and control groups. The treatment group will undergo three treatments one week
      apart. The control group will have an osteopathic structural exam without treatment. During
      the first treatment weeks both groups will undergo balance testing on a force plate pre and
      post intervention. Additional balance testing will take place one week after last
      intervention. Six variables will be compared between groups used a linear mixed model
      analysis.
    ",,,,,,,,21-Nov-19,Actual,,"
      Participants will go through an informed consent process, fill out a screening questionnaire
      and will undergo neurological testing. If there are any abnormalities in their neurological
      testing or they meet exclusion criteria, they will not be included in the study. The
      neurological testing will include reflex testing, sensation testing, strength testing, and
      coordination and balance tests.

      Participants will then be randomized into 2 groups. One control and one treatment.

      Each group will have their balance measured using the portable force plate. Participants will
      be tested on both feet with arms crossed and eyes open for 60 seconds, and both feet with
      arms crossed and eyes closed for 60 seconds. Then they will be given 15 seconds to practice
      standing on the force plate on only their right leg with eyes open and arms crossed. The
      investigators will then test their balance on their right leg with arms crossed and eyes open
      for 30 seconds. They will be given 15 seconds to practice standing on their right leg with
      their arms crossed and eyes closed, and then will have their balance tested on their right
      leg with arms crossed and eyes closed for 30 seconds. The same sequence of events will take
      place for the left leg as their right leg. This sequence of measurements will take place at
      the beginning and end of their first treatment visit. For the standing test with eyes closed
      and all single leg tests someone will be standing beside the force plate with an arm and
      either side of the participant to prevent the participant from falling and hurting
      themselves.

      The force plate calculates the center of mass of the participant, the area that is covered by
      the center of mass, the length of the path of center of mass, the velocity of its motion, and
      the maximum sway in the x and y planes.

      During the single leg tests, the investigators will also record the time of when the
      participant brings the other foot down, touches the two legs together, or if the sternum
      becomes outside the borders of the pelvis, if they do lose their balance The test duration
      will be 30 seconds, as stated previously.

      Between the two balance tests, the treatment group will receive a full-body osteopathic
      manipulative treatment according to the Common Compensatory Pattern (CCP). CCP is a treatment
      approach developed by Dr. Zinc that addresses the transition areas of the body. The treatment
      will be given by one of the four fellows under supervision by a licensed physician and last
      10-20 minutes. The treatment will include the following body regions:

      Occipito-atlantal Joint Thoracic Inlet Thoraco-lumbar shift Lumbo-pelvic roll Ribs Sacrum
      Pelvis Upslip Upper extremity Lower extremity

      The fellows will diagnose somatic dysfunctions within these body regions, treat, and reassess
      to make sure the somatic dysfunctions are resolved. The physician will perform a spinal sweep
      and side-to-side height assessments before and after treatment to verify there was
      improvement in somatic dysfunctions.

      After the treatment, the treatment group will walk around the perimeter of the lab for 5
      minutes before retesting their balance.

      The control group will be asked to lay on an OMM (Osteopathic Manual Medicine) treatment for
      15 minutes. They will then walk around the perimeter of the lab for 5 minutes before
      retesting their balance.

      The treatment group will come for five visits. The first visit will include the informed
      consent and neurological exam. The second visit will include a balance measurement, a
      treatment, and a follow-up balance measurement immediately after the treatment. The next two
      visits will consist only of osteopathic treatments. Each visit will be spaced one week apart.
      The participant will come back a week after their last treatment and complete follow-up
      balance testing.

      The control group will have a total of five visits. They will have the same initial visit as
      the treatment group with informed consent and neurological exam. Their second visit will
      consist of a balance measurement, have somatic dysfunctions be diagnosed, yet not be treated
      and have an immediate follow-up measurement. The third and fourth visits will consist of
      diagnosing somatic dysfunctions without any treatment. The last visit will consist of a
      follow-up balance testing. Each of these visits will be one week apart.

      The data from the force that will be used includes area that the center of mass covers,
      length of pathway of center of mass, velocity of the center of mass, medial-lateral sway, and
      anterior-posterior sway. The investigators will also use the length of time participants were
      able to stand on one leg without losing their balance (without moving their knee or chest
      outside of their midline, their foot leaving the platform, touching their opposite foot to
      the ground, or letting their legs touch).

      Summary descriptive statistics will be first obtained for the selected variables and
      demographics covariates as appropriate. For a particular variable, the change between pre-
      (or baseline) and post- treatment during the first week reflects the immediate treatment
      effect while the difference between the pre-treatment baseline and the last measurement
      during week 4 represents the long-term lasting accumulative effect. The data bear the
      characteristics of repeated measurements on the same study participants since more than one
      measurements are taken on the same study participant over time. Thus, it is usually plausible
      to assume the measurements on the same individual subjects are correlated. Ignoring the
      covariance between such measurements may result in erroneous statistical inference, and
      avoiding it by data transformation may result in inefficient statistical inference. The
      statistical technique of linear mixed model allows the covariance structure to be integrated
      into the modeling while accounting for the randomness of the study subjects. Thus, the data
      will be analyzed separately for each variable with a linear mixed-effect model with repeated
      measures design to assess the OMT effects on the balance measurement metrics over time. In
      the model fitting process, several candidate covariance structures will be selected and
      evaluated according to the experimental design (i.e., unequal spacing of the time points but
      with the same time points across the study participants, within-subject correlation over time
      and convergence of model fitting), out of which one optimal covariance structure will be
      selected by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) criteria. On the basis of the chosen
      models for the respective variables, statistical contrasts will be set up to compare the mean
      values of variable measurements between time points to assess the immediate and long-term
      effects of OMT treatment. Tukey procedure for the multiple testing adjustment will be used to
      compute the adjusted p-value in case of need.

      Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention (EMAI) is an emerging technique for
      gathering richer and more relevant data through repeated, longitudinal sampling of
      participants in their natural setting in order to deliver real-time interventions. The main
      study objective is to conduct a pilot EMAI study in Rakai, Uganda. Secondary objectives are
      to assess processes, facilitators, and barriers to EMAI. The study will compare behaviors
      between participants randomized to receive intervention messages and those not receiving
      messages. To assess EMAI validity and relevance, EMAI-collected behavioral data will be
      compared with traditional questionnaire-collected data.

      After recruitment, participants will be given a smartphone with an application that will
      collect geospatial coordinates and ask behavioral assessment questions on topics including
      diet/alcohol, smoking, and sexual behaviors. Participants will have training on the phone and
      application, demonstrating proficiency with the EMAI interface prior to study start.

      Days 1-30, Baseline Behaviors: Participants will complete assessment questions to establish
      baseline behaviors. This will include twice-daily and weekly behavioral report prompts and
      participant-initiated event-contingent behavioral reports. After the initial 30 day period,
      participants will return to the study office to complete a short questionnaire and to be
      randomized to the second phase of follow-up.

      Days 31-90, Randomized Evaluation: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
      continue assessment questions only (control arm) or to also begin receiving intervention
      messages (intervention arm) in response to reported behaviors. Messages will encourage
      positive behaviors and suggest alternatives to negative behaviors (e.g. ""Eating a mixed diet
      (meats and vegetables) is a healthy way to go.""). At 90 days of follow-up, participants will
      return to the study office to complete a brief questionnaire on behaviors and smartphone
      experiences.

      Study hypotheses are as follows: EMAI can be successfully implemented in Uganda, and
      participants receiving intervention messaging will have improved self-reported health
      behaviors compared to controls; EMAI will be feasible and acceptable by this population; and,
      EMAI-collected data will correlate with traditional questionnaire-collected data.

      Outcomes will be assessed using descriptive statistics, multivariate regression and analysis
      of themes in patient EMAI experience and acceptability.

      The xenograft used in this study was the Gen-Os® by OsteoBiol; The soft lamina (OsteoBiol®)
      used is a 35x35mm medium curved membrane of porcine origins.

      The fixation system used was the Pro-fix™ Precision Fixation System, consisting of
      self-drilling membrane fixation screws of 1.5 mm x 3.0 mm.

      Fifteen patients (1 male, 14 females) aged between 27 and 64 years old were selected from the
      Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of Dentistry, Saint Joseph University Beirut.

      Clinical and radiographic examinations were done prior to any procedure. The edentulous area
      was examined to identify the availability of keratinised mucosa and the possibility of
      implant placement in the mesio-distal and inter-arch planes. Radiographic examination was
      completed using a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of the affected region, where the
      indication for vertical augmentation was selected and excluded from the study. All the
      patients were given oral hygiene instructions and prophylaxis.

      Each patient received 2g of Amoxicillin one hour prior to surgery. Patients were instructed
      to mouthrinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% gluconate mouthwash for 1 minute. Extra-oral
      disinfection was made using topical chlorhexidine.

      Local and/or regional anaesthesia was obtained using Septanest® (Articaine hydrochloride 4%
      with adrenaline 1:100,000) A mid-crestal incision was performed and extended into the sulcus
      of the adjacent teeth, if present. At least one vertical releasing incision extending beyond
      the muco-gingival junction was made. A muco-periosteal flap of full thickness was raised and
      extended buccally, whereas palatally it was reflected to expose 3 mm of bone. Lingually the
      flap was elevated until reaching the mylo-hyoid line. Decortication was carried out using a
      twist drill with a stop of 3mm of length to ensure a good perfusion of the graft.

      The soft cortical lamina had been soaked in saline sterile water since the beginning of the
      surgery in order to achieve good elasticity and easier manipulation. It was then trimmed with
      sterile scissors and adapted to the recipient site while making sure it was not in contact
      with the surrounding teeth. It was first fixed on the palatal/lingual side. The
      cortico-cancellous heterologous bone mix which was previously hydrated in sterile saline for
      ten minutes, was placed on the ridge in sufficient quantities and covered by the membrane
      while being adapted in the desired shape of the future ridge. The membrane was reclined and
      also fixated on the buccal side for better adaptability and immobilization. In order to
      ensure a tension free closure, the buccal flap was advanced using a periosteal releasing
      incision connecting the vertical incisions thus achieving elasticity of the flap. Precaution
      was taken to identify and carefully isolate the mental nerve from the surrounding tissues
      when present. The lingual flaps were advanced using a blunt instrument to detach the muscular
      insertion of the mylo-hyoid from the lingual flap.

      Once proper elasticity was achieved, horizontal mattress sutures were placed at 4mm from the
      incision line using a non-resorbable polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) 4/0 monofilament suture.

      They were followed by single interrupted sutures close to the edges of the flap in order to
      create a connective tissue-connective tissue contact, thus creating a barrier to reduce the
      incidence of membrane exposure.

      All patients were instructed to receive an injection of betamethasone dipropionate and
      disodium phosphate directly after the surgery and received 2g of Amoxicillin per day for a
      total of 7 days.

      Post-operative recommendations were clearly written and given to the patient. Chlorhexidine
      was prescribed starting the second day after surgery until suture removal.

      Sutures were removed at 14 days, they were left for another 7 days when found necessary to
      secure the healing.

      At 6 months from the surgery, a CBCT scan of the grafted area was taken and measures were
      made for the choice of the implant diameter and length. In all of the post-operative CBCTs,
      implant placement seemed possible.

      On the day of the implant placement, local anaesthesia was made, followed by a mid-crestal
      incision and occasionally a vertical one, allowing access to the fixation screws for their
      removal.

      A biopsy was taken at the site of implant placement using a trephine burr of outer diameter
      of 3.5mm and inner diameter of 2.5mm. The trephine and bone were immersed in 10% buffered
      formaldehyde and fixated for histology. The implants (Straumann®, Bone Level Cylindrical)
      were placed at the corresponding sites of the biopsies, and the choice of a cover or a
      healing screw was made depending on the clinical situation and the primary stability of the
      implant.

      Implant insertion torques were noted as indicated on the implant torque wrench. Periapical
      radio-graphs were taken, the flap was sutured and the patients received a daily dose of 2g of
      Amoxicillin for 7 days and diclofenac potassium inflammatory for pain management. They were
      also notified to mouth rinse with Chlorhexidine 0.12% for 10 days.

      Radiological protocol

      Image acquisition:

      At consultation and six months after the regeneration procedure, patients were scanned with
      the Newton VGI CBCT machine. Imaging conditions were: 110 kv tube voltage; 2.2 to 8.30
      milliampere (mA) tube current; 15 x 15 cm field of view; and 0.3 mm voxel size. Projection
      data were collected with a device rotating 360 degrees around patients over a total
      acquisition time of 18 seconds.

      Evaluation of images:

      Scan data were saved in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format and
      image analysis and measurements were performed using the Blue Sky Plan® (Blue Sky Bio, LLC,
      Grayslake, IL, USA) which provided axial, coronal and sagittal views through multiplanar
      reconstructions of 0.3 mm slices. Axial images were reoriented to occlusal plane when present
      or to palatal plane as a horizontal reference. A panoramic curve was created and
      cross-sectional images perpendicular to that curve were reconstructed at a 1 mm interval.

      Advanced jaw segmentation:

      For each scan, an advanced jaw segmentation technique was realized using the Blue Sky Plan
      software by means of threshold segmentation and contour interpolation. First the region of
      interest (corresponding jaw) was selected on the panoramic view. Second, several axial,
      coronal and cross-sectional slices equally distributed/chosen by the software were used to
      draw the outline of the bone. This created a matrix to the final automatic segmentation step
      by the software to finalize the segmentation data and create a 3D model of the jaw. Finally,
      the outline of the 3D model was checked and adjusted manually on the 2D slices in all the
      planes in cases of over or missing contour. The result was an accurate 3D model of the
      corresponding jaw.

      Virtual implant placement and jaw superimposition:

      On the post-operative CBCT plan, virtual implants were placed in the optimal position
      regarding bone and prosthetic reference when present.

      In order to compare directly the pre and post-operative models, the pre-operative bone model
      was loaded into the post-operative plan an n-point registration technique was used for the
      superimposition of the two models. The outline of each model was visible in a unique color
      for comparison.

      A vestibulo-lingual implant centric section perpendicular to the panoramic curve and parallel
      to the long axis of the simulated implant was used to make all the measurements as follow:

      Horizontal bone width measurements

      For each implant site, pre and post-operative horizontal bone width were measured at 4
      levels. Bone width was calculated from the distance between the most buccal and most lingual
      bone points at each level while being parallel to the simulated implant platform.

        -  H0-T1 and H0-T2: Pre and post-operative horizontal bone width at implant platform level.

        -  H2-T1 and H2-T2: Pre and post-operative horizontal bone width at 2mm apically to implant
           platform.

        -  H4-T1 and H4-T2: Pre and post-operative horizontal bone width at 4mm apically to implant
           platform.

      Vertical bone gain/loss measurements

      For each implant site, pre and post-operative vertical bone gain were measured at 3 levels.
      Vertical bone gain/loss was calculated from the distance between the most coronal
      pre-operative bone points.

      Histology

      Fixation and inclusion:

      Samples were taken at six months after regeneration and were treated with non-demineralized
      histology. They were fixed in LILLIE neutral formalin, diluted to 10% in buffered sodium
      phosphate pH 7.4. The fixation period lasted 3 weeks. The samples were then rinsed under
      running water for 48 hours.

      The dehydration of the samples was carried out in alcohol baths of increasing concentrations
      for 48 hours, then the clarification, allowing the penetration of methacrylate, in 2
      successive xylene baths of 24 hours each.

      Cutting technique:

      The blocks were cut under irrigation and at slow speed with an Exact saw (Cutting machine
      EXACT-APPARATEBAU Nordersted, Germany), so as to take cuts of at least 80 μm. These cuts were
      subsequently reduced in thickness with the Exact abrasion system. The polishing was carried
      out with abrasive paper discs of decreasing granulometry making it possible to reduce the
      thickness of the cuts automatically to the desired value. The cuts were separated into S
      (superficial), M (median) and P (profound) cuts, the superficial ones being the cuts facing
      the periosteum.

      Staining:

      The sections were stained with Giemsa-Paragon and basic fuchsin. Giemsa will give cells and
      nuclei the color blue, and Paragon will stain bone in red.

      Histomorphometry:

      The qualitative observation of the sections was done under a digital microscope (Keyence
      digital microscope VHX-6000) with normal and polarized light visualisations. For histological
      quantification, an optical microscope was used (Olympus BX 60, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo,
      Japan) connected to a digital camera (Olympus E330), along with the software Image J/ Fiji.

      It was first calibrated by measuring the scale bar present on the image. The image was made
      into black and white (Type: 8-bit). The scale was set by measuring the length of the scale
      bar in pixels and by setting its known distance in millimetres. It was then set as 'Global'
      for all the images with the same scale.

      The total area of the concerned section was measured. Then the bone and osteoid volume were
      quantified using the Bone Volume Mask and by using the 'wand tool' to select all the black
      areas. The percentage of bone and osteoid matrix in each section was consequently calculated.

      Statistical analysis:

      The statistical package software for social sciences (SPSS for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA,
      version 25.0) was performed for statistical analysis of the data. The alpha error was set at
      -p-value<0.05. Frequency and percentage were utilized to describe categorical variables. Mean
      and standard-deviation were used for continuous variables.

        -  Repeated measure analysis of variance with two within-subjects factors (Time: Baseline
           and six months; distance: 0mm, 2mm, 4mm, and 6 mm) was performed to compare the mean
           bone level within groups. It was followed by univariate analyses and Bonferroni post hoc
           tests.

        -  Repeated measure analysis of variance with one within-subjects factor (distance: 0mm,
           2mm, 4mm, and 6 mm) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests was used to compare the mean
           horizontal gain.

        -  Repeated measure analysis of variance with one within-subjects factor (level: buccal,
           median, lingual) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests was executed to compare the mean
           vertical gain.

        -  One sample t tests were used to compare the mean vertical gain with a theoretical value
           ""0'' that supposed the absence of gain.

        -  Student t tests were performed to compare continuous variables between two groups.

        -  Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between
           continuous variables.

        -  Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare histomorphometric measurements between
           different levels.

      During the thyroid surgery, the identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the
      dissection through its entry point is still the gold standard in prevention of the nerve
      injury and to decrease the RLN palsy rate. Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) has also so
      many benefits to search, identify and dissect the nerve through its course during thyroid
      surgery and especially the most important benefit of the IONM is to have real time
      information about the function of the RLN. Most of the endocrine surgeons use the
      inferolateral approach for RLN identification under the guidance of the IONM in the recent

      approach in which a way that most of the surgeons are not familiar with. The different

      Postoperative constipation, defined as no fully satisfying bowel movement within the first

      between 41 and 85% of postoperative patients experience symptoms. Causes include
      intraoperative medications, postoperative opioid analgesics, decreased mobility, and
      decreased oral intake. Constipation significantly impacts quality of life following surgery.

      single total knee arthroplasty at Cleveland Clinic is discharge on postoperative day one with
      either a prescription to be filled for docusate sodium (brand name Colace®) 100 mg to be
      taken two times a day by mouth for twenty eight days or the filled prescription, plus
      discharge instructions on ways to avoid and treat constipation. Research results show that
      docusate sodium is ineffective for preventing postoperative constipation in orthopedic
      surgery patients, and anecdotal reports confirm this finding. The proposed study uses a
      2-group non-equivalent cohort design to evaluate the effect of one standard dose (17 grams)
      of an over-the-counter osmotic laxative (propylene glycol (PEG 3350), brand name Miralax) by
      mouth prior to discharge to the current standard of care. The primary outcome measure is
      whether patients report of a fully satisfying, normal for them, bowel movement within the
      first three postoperative days. Patient reported data will be collected by phone call four to
      seven days following surgery. Pertinent patient characteristics will be abstracted from the
      electronic medical record. The sample will consist of patients over twenty years old having a
      single total knee arthroplasty by Drs. Stearns, Molloy, or Murray who are admitted to unit 5D
      at Cleveland Clinic Lutheran Hospital postoperatively. Intent to treat analysis will be
      performed using logistic and linear regression models, adjusting for differences between
      groups on patient and surgical characteristics. Based on use of a two-sided Pearson
      chi-square test with 80% power and significance level of 0.05, 49 patients per group are
      required to detect a 25% decrease in constipation rate. To account for attrition we will over
      sample by 50% for a total of 74 per group or 148 total participants.

      This study is an online survey to assess risk literacy among students of the medical and
      dentistry faculties in Portugal. Risk literacy is the capability to understand and interpret
      statistical information, based on simple rules of thumb.

      The investigators assess the level of ""medical risk literacy"" among Portuguese medical and
      dentistry students with the Quick Risk Test (QRT) and the multiple choice version of the
      Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT).
    ",,,,,,,,31-Jul-20,Actual,,"
      This study is an online survey to assess risk literacy among students of the medical and
      dentistry faculties in Portugal.

      The primary outcome is the measurement of ""medical risk literacy"" among Portuguese medical
      and dentistry students as assessed with the Quick Risk Test (QRT) and the multiple choice
      version of the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT).

      Secondary outcomes is to investigate whether study year, faculty, and prior statistical
      education have an impact on the level of risk literacy. Participants will be invited via
      email through established faculty mailing lists or established social media channels. For the
      survey, an online-survey tool (Unipark, academic program or Questback) will be used.
      Participation is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time by aborting the survey (e.g. via
      closing the browser). Informed consent will be acquired at the beginning of the survey.
      English and Portuguese versions will be available to the participant.

      As incentive to participate, participants completing the brief (ca.15 minutes)
      online-questionnaire will be granted a free subscriptions to the AMBOSS medical learning
      platform (2 weeks) and have the option to be entered into a lottery with the possibility of
      winning one of 3 free 6 month subscriptions.

      After completion of the questionnaire, participants will be re-directed to a dedicated AMBOSS
      website where they can enter their email-address to take part in the lottery. This assures
      strict separation of the anonymous experimental data and the AMBOSS subscription data. Prior
      to initiation of the questionnaire, in the invitation email, participants will be provided
      the full participant information and made aware that, due to anonymity, it will not be
      possible to retrospectively delete their responses once the survey has been completed.

      As the primary outcome is a baseline assessment and the secondary outcomes are exploratory
      analyses, no hypotheses will be tested in this survey.

      An anonymous online survey will be conducted to measure the barriers and facilitators parents
      and teachers experience to positively influencing children's hand-hygiene. A sub-section of
      the survey will also examine the barriers and facilitators they experience to surface
      cleaning. The final survey will be conducted with participants from Australia, China, India,
      Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The data collected will be
      completely anonymous and there are no sensitive questions. The primary and secondary analyses
      will focus on the hand-hygiene items to examine the survey's internal and external validity.
      The results will inform a future school-based intervention.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of Nurse Led Transitional Care Model (TCM) on the functional

      heart surgery.
    ",,,,,,,,15-Dec-18,Actual,,"
      Rate and number of successful cases in open heart surgery has been increasing due to the
      advances in medical technology and surgery. To improve patient convalescence results and
      reduce rate of post-discharge readmission to hospital and unplanned post-discharge
      rehospitalization, home-care and follow-up process of patients should be managed
      successfully.

      A total of 66 elderly patients who agreed to participate in the study between November 2017
      and December 2018 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n: 33) and control (n: 33)
      groups. Patients in intervention group were given care based on the TCM until the post
      discharge 9th week starting from date of hospitalization. Patients in control group were
      given standard care services. Functional autonomy and quality of life levels of patients were
      evaluated at admission to the clinic and at the post-discharge 9th week whereas their
      repeated admission rates to the clinic and re-hospitalization rates were evaluated at post
      discharge 2nd, 6th and 9th weeks and finally 6 months. The CONSORT checklist was used to
      check the procedure.

      One of the major problems in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders, is the
      lack of cost effective and reliable tools to assess neurodegeneration on a large scale at a
      very early stage. Although current imaging methods give a clear image of the brain atrophy
      involved in neurodegenerative disorders, there are deficiencies prohibiting their usage for
      prevention-scanning of large high-risk population such as high price, long set-up time and
      the need for trained personnel to conduct the test. An objective tool to asses the level of
      cognitive decline is therefore needed. Such a tool may be used to determine the level of
      cognitive decline independent of personal interpretation and/or variance between clinicians
      and provide consistency in assessment across patients and between medical facilities.

      The Neurosteer system provides objective neurological biomarkers using a wearable easy-to-use
      affordable system. The system facilitate the capture and interpretation of EEG data with only
      a single patch of electrodes, attached on the subject's forehead. Neurosteer examination
      includes completing auditory tasks while measuring brain activity with the device. The data
      is analyzed using machine learning methods to produce biomarkers, enabling a report of the
      patient's activity in real time and offline. The examination is easy to preform and can be
      conducted in every clinic or in patients' homes.

      In this study, clinical staff will identify potential subjects and will examine the
      eligibility of subject according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients (or legal
      guardian) will sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Research staff will set up an assessment
      session using Neurosteer system. In this session the patient will listen to the auditory
      assessment battery and perform tasks. Level of cognition will be assessed by Neurosteer
      technology and statistical analysis will be performed to validate the results.

      In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus named as
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city,
      China, and spread exponentially throughout China and other countries in the following weeks.

      It is recommended that elective endoscopies should be deferred during the COVID-19 outbreak
      for the potential transmission between patients and medical staff in the statements of Asian
      Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE-COVID statements). Therefore, exploring an
      alternative for patients with the requirements of endoscopy during the outbreak is of great
      importance.

      Herein,the investigators developed an novel non-contact magnetically-controlled capsule
      endoscopy (Nc-MCE) system (Figure 1) adds a remote control workstation and a audio-visual
      exchange system to the original well-established MCE system.

      This study was a open-label, prospective, randomized controlled study approved by the
      institutional review board of Shanghai Changhai Hospital. It was designed to evaluate the
      diagnostic utility, safety, feasibility and patients acceptability of Nc-MCE in patients with
      an indication of endoscopy, and comparing it with the result of MCE.

      was able to see the patient and communicate with him or her through the audio-visual exchange
      system all the time. In order to simplify the examination procedure, the data recorder was
      putted on the examination bed. The patient lay down after swallowing the capsule under the
      remote guidance of the endoscopist.And the endoscopist of MCE and nc-MCE was the same one
      with experience of more than 1000 cases of MCCG operation.

      The investigators recruited 40 patients who have related symptom and healthy people mainly
      from outpatient clinic or hospital health examination center. After fully understanding the
      procedure of nc-MCE, patients with informed consent were randomly divided into MCE group and
      nc-MCE group(1:1) by using a stratified block randomization(block size four).

      The basic characteristics of the enrolled patients were prospectively collected. The primary
      endpoint was the maneuverability score evaluated by endoscopist. And the investigators choose
      the gastric examination time,the comfort and acceptability of patients, diagnostic yield and
      completeness of gastric examination as the secondary endpoint. The safety endpoint of nc-MCE
      was evaluated by the occurrence of adverse events.

      Free gingival graft (FGG) was first proposed by Bjorn 1963 and Nabers 1966. FGG is indicated
      to correct mucogingival problems such as inadequate or lack of attached gingiva and gingival
      recession. The most frequent donor site for free gingival graft is the palate

      Although, great concern has been given to the recipient sites by using different techniques
      as suturing, tissue adhesives and special dressings, a little attention was given to protect
      the donor sites after free gingival graft harvesting. The palatal donor site heal by
      secondary intention, it could take around 2 to 4 weeks depending on the width and thickness
      of the tissue removed.The common clinical events that occurs following FGG procedure are
      patient's discomfort, pain and bleeding at the donor site.
    ",,,,,,,,1-Feb-20,Actual,,"
      In an attempt to protect the plate (donor site) so that it could help in decreasing the
      patient's post operative pain, Farnoush suggested variant clinical techniques. One of these
      techniques was interproximal wire ligation by placing a stainless steel wire anchored on the
      teeth stabilizing the periodontal dressing. He also suggested using a modified Hawley
      appliance which would act as a palatal stent protecting the palate to help in healing.

      After periodontal surgeries, the donor site (palate) has to be protected from the external
      environment by many dressing materials. Conventional periodontal dressings provide an inert
      barrier that help healing by preventing the external insults on the wound area. However,
      these dressings do not affect the cellular behavior and do not display a role in the
      biological events that happen during wound healing.

      Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a simple procedure where patient's own blood is collected and
      centrifuged. PRF clot forms a strong fibrin matrix that can be compressed to form a membrane.
      PRF membrane consists of a fibrin 3D mesh polymerized in a specific structure that
      incorporates platelets, leukocytes, growth factors; and the circulating stem cells.PRF
      membrane enhance angiogenesis, immunity and wound epithelialisation. Thus, based on such
      findings the PRF membrane can be used as a palatal dressing

      PRF membrane enhances the healing of the donor site (palate).According to Shakir et al.,
      complete epithelialisation of the palatal donor site was reached by 18th day after FGG in the
      groups where PRF membranes was placed with less pain scores on the 2nd and 7th day than the
      control group. Therefore PRF membranes showed higher capabilities of the donor site healing
      stimulation.

      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a high molecular weight, non-sulphated polysaccharide component of
      the family of the glycosaminoglycanes,it is present in various body fluids such as synovial
      fluid, serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. In addition, it represents an important
      component of the extracellular matrix of skin, connective tissue, synovial joints and other
      tissues. HA is identified in all periodontal tissues, being prominent in the non-mineralized
      tissues such as gingiva and periodontal ligament, and in low quantities in mineralized
      tissues such as cementum and alveolar bone.

      Hyaluronic acid has been suggested as monotherapy or as an adjunct to non-surgical and/or
      surgical periodontal treatment to reduce inflammation and promote wound healing. Hyaluronic
      acid can be used to accelerate the palatal wound healing at the donor site after free
      gingival graft surgery

      This is a double-blinded crossover study to evaluate whether Eudragit® content impacts the
      ability to self-insert placebo vaginal films. Thirty women will self-insert one high and and
      one low Eudragit® content film. The insertion order will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. After
      inserting each film, participants will complete a survey reporting their perceptions and
      experience. The primary endpoint is successful insertion defined as all of the film inside
      the vagina upon visual assessment by a study clinician. Secondary outcomes include preference
      for the low level or high level Eudragit® formulation film with respect to insertion and
      participants' description of identified challenges.

      This is a double-blinded crossover study to evaluate whether ammonio methacrylate copolymer
      dispersion type B (Eudragit®) content impacts the ability to self-insert placebo vaginal
      films. Eudragit® is a commonly used pharmaceutical excipient, present in several FDA approved
      products. This hydrophobic excipient is used in vaginal film formulations to increase
      disintegration time and impart extended drug release property. The presence of Eudragit and
      its concentration level affects film disintegration and spreadability in the vaginal
      environment, and are likely to affect tactile properties. Consequently, these attributes may
      impact ease of film administration, acceptability, and user preferences for specific film
      type.

      Thirty pre-menopausal women, 18 - 45 years of age, will self-insert one high and and one low
      Eudragit® content film. High and low Eudragit films correspond to 12.8% and 6.4% of Eudragit®
      added during the formulation blending stage. The insertion order will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio. Within 10 minutes of the insertion, clinical staff will perform a speculum exam to
      assess the location of the film and remove the residual film. After inserting each film,
      participants will complete a survey reporting their perceptions and experience. The primary
      endpoint is successful insertion defined as all of the film inside the vagina upon visual
      assessment by a study clinician. Secondary outcomes include preference for the low level or
      high level Eudragit® formulation film with respect to insertion and participants' description
      of identified challenges.

      This is a seven day study to clinically evaluate the effectiveness of the Sustained Acoustic
      Medicine (SAM) device combined with diclofenac on symptoms of patients suffering from knee
      osteoarthritis. The class-II device, sam® has been FDA-cleared for home use. On the first day
      of the study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain score before treatment.
      During the following 6 days, patients will self-apply the wearable SAM device with diclofenac
      patch to their affected knee for 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores will be
      recorded immediately before application of SAM device as well as 30 minutes, 2-hours and
      4-hours after applying the device. A quality of life and function assessment will be
      performed prior to the patient beginning the protocol and at the conclusion of the protocol.

      Up to 32 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study sites. The
      study is designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and
      socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals.

      Aim: To evaluate the viability of an educational intervention for the prevention of breast
      cancer risk and the modification of their risk behaviors through the use of a web application
      in women living in the Principality of Asturias.

      Design: pilot test Population: 300 women without breast cancer living in Asturias. 25 to 50
      years old. They are recluted for a previous study developed by the same research team. An
      information document and a written consent was given for the women. Those who signed the
      consent are included.

      The randomization for intervention or control group are doing based on the where the city
      where the women home is located. the objective of this distribution is to avoid contact
      between women from different groups.

      Variables: personal characteristics (age, status, educational level, civil status), MIC
      index, dietary characteristics, level of physical activity, knowledge related with breast
      cancer symptoms and risk factors.

      Intervention:

      The 6 months intervention are going to be developed using a web-app. The intervention is
      based on the Behavior Change Wheel model. Capacity and motivation are going to be the
      determinants on which it will work using for it interventions based on education, persuasion
      and modeling among others.

      Intervention Group: 6 months intervention using a web-app related. The web-app includes some
      sections:

        -  Information related with breast cancer risk.

        -  Breast self examination. Written text and videos done by a nurse.

        -  Physical exercise. Written text and videos done by a physiotherapist .

        -  Dietary information. Written text and videos done by a nutrition expert.

      The Control Group are not going to receive intervention during the study period time. After
      that, women are going to be access to the web-app.

      Statistical analysis

      Descriptive statistics will be carried out (means, standard deviation, CI and percentages).
      In addition, at the end of the study, in order to determine the factibility of the
      educational intervention, the variation of the intra-group data (from pre to psot-test) and
      between the groups in post-test will be compared using the chi-square test. , t-student or
      Mann-Whitney U, for qualitative or quantitative data respectively.

      Ranitidine is an over-the-counter and prescription drug, which decreases the amount of acid
      secreted by the stomach. Some ranitidine medicines contain an impurity called
      N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is classified as a probable human
      carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests. NDMA
      is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy
      products, and vegetables.

      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found levels of NDMA in some ranitidine
      products similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like
      grilled or smoked meats. The ranitidine that will be used in this study has been tested twice
      (months apart) and shown to have stable NDMA levels well below the acceptable daily limit. Of
      note, the risk of NDMA with ranitidine is only relevant with prolonged chronic administration
      as at the acceptable limit, there is approximately a 1 in 100,000 chance of cancer after 70
      years of exposure to that level.

      FDA has also conducted tests that simulate the potential formation of NDMA from ranitidine
      after it has been exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. Results of these tests
      indicate that NDMA is not formed in typical stomach conditions. Similarly, if ranitidine is
      exposed to a simulated small intestinal fluid, NDMA is not formed. Other laboratory
      experiments suggest a combination of nitrites, such as found in processed meats, and an
      acidic environment may increase NDMA formation, however the levels of nitrites tested were
      very high. Separately, a previous study in 10 healthy volunteers showed that volunteers who
      received ranitidine had an increase in urinary NDMA excreted over 24 h. The level of increase
      was greater than would be expected from laboratory testing.

      This clinical study is being performed to determine if and how much NDMA is produced from
      ranitidine in the human body and whether nitrite-containing foods may increase formation of
      NDMA. The study will use a prescription dose of ranitidine (300 mg) to test whether there is
      increased urinary NDMA excretion levels over 24-hours after ranitidine administration in
      comparison to placebo when participants are administered low nitrite/NDMA meals and when
      subjects are administered high nitrite/NDMA meals. On 4 different days, each participant will

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has learned that some ranitidine medicines,
      including some products commonly known as the brand-name drug Zantac, contain a nitrosamine
      impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is classified as a probable
      human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory
      tests. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including
      meats, dairy products, and vegetables.

      The FDA has been investigating NDMA and other nitrosamine impurities in blood pressure and
      heart failure medicines called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) since 2018. In the
      case of ARBs, the FDA has recommended numerous recalls as it discovered unacceptable levels
      of nitrosamines.

      FDA has found levels of NDMA in ranitidine active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished
      drugs that are similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common
      foods like grilled or smoked meats. FDA has requested removal of all ranitidine products from
      the market because some ranitidine products have NDMA levels above the acceptable limits (96
      nanograms per day or 0.32 parts per million for 300 mg per day of ranitidine) and that levels
      of NDMA in ranitidine may increase to unacceptable levels over time. However, FDA has not
      withdrawn approvals of ranitidine new drug applications and abbreviated new drug applications
      and if a company can show, through scientific data, that their ranitidine product is stable
      and the NDMA levels do not increase over time to unsafe levels, FDA may consider allowing
      that ranitidine product back on the U.S. market. The ranitidine that will be used in this
      study has been tested twice (months apart) and shown to have stable NDMA levels well below
      the acceptable daily limit. Of note, the risk of NDMA with ranitidine is only relevant with
      prolonged chronic administration as at the acceptable limit, there is approximately a 1 in
      100,000 chance of cancer after 70 years of exposure to that level.

      FDA has also conducted tests that simulate the potential formation of NDMA from ranitidine
      after it has been exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. Results of these tests
      indicate that NDMA is not formed in typical stomach conditions. Similarly, if ranitidine is
      exposed to a simulated small intestinal fluid, NDMA is not formed. Other in vitro experiments
      suggest a combination of nitrites, such as found in processed meats, and an acidic
      environment potentiate formation of NDMA. For that reason, prior to requesting removal of
      ranitidine products from the market, the FDA had advised consumers who wished to continue
      taking these medications to consider limiting consumption of nitrite-containing foods.

      Separately, a previous study in 10 healthy volunteers showed that single dose administration
      of ranitidine 150 mg was associated with ~400-fold increase in urinary NDMA excreted over 24
      h. This level of increase is substantially greater than would be expected from laboratory
      testing. Further evaluation is necessary to determine if and how much NDMA is produced from
      ranitidine in the human body and whether nitrite-containing foods may potentiate formation of
      NDMA in vivo.

      Ranitidine

      Ranitidine is an over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drug. Ranitidine is an histamine-2
      (H2) blocker, which decreases the amount of acid secreted by the stomach. Over-the-counter
      ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid ingestion and
      sour stomach and the approved dosage regiment is up to 150 mg twice a day. Prescription
      ranitidine is approved for multiple indications, including treatment and prevention of ulcers
      of the stomach and intestines and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and the
      approved dosage regimen is up to 150 mg twice a day or 300 mg once a day.

      Study Primary Objective

      1. To evaluate 24-hour urinary excretion of NDMA after oral administration of ranitidine
      compared to placebo

      Study Exploratory Objectives

        1. To evaluate plasma ranitidine, NDMA, and dimethylamine (DMA) after oral administration
           of ranitidine compared to placebo

        2. To evaluate urinary excretion amounts over 24-hours of ranitidine and DMA after oral
           administration of ranitidine compared to placebo

        3. To evaluate 24-hour urinary excretion and plasma concentration of NDMA and DMA with
           administration of high nitrite/NDMA meals compared to low nitrite/NDMA meals

      Study Design

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, 4-period crossover study with 18
      healthy subjects. Subjects check-in on Day -2 and receive the following 4 treatments starting
      on Day 1, with one washout day between treatment days. The treatments consist of oral
      administration of either a single dose of ranitidine (300 mg) or placebo administered at time
      0 hr. All subjects will be provided low nitrite/NDMA meals for the first two periods of the
      study and high nitrite/NDMA meals for the last two periods of the study. This ordering of
      meals will allow purchasing a single lot of perishable items for different meals and to
      simplify meal preparation and serving at the study site. The four treatments are:

      A. Ranitidine + low nitrite/NDMA meal;

      B. Placebo + low nitrite/NDMA meal;

      C. Ranitidine + high nitrite/NDMA meal;

      D. Placebo + high nitrite/NDMA meal.

      Subjects will report to the study site for screening from Days -28 to -3 and then will return
      to the site on Day -2 for baseline assessments. Subjects will receive three standardized
      meals and an evening snack per day starting on Day -1. Subjects will be served meals from a
      pre-specified menu for check-in and for all washout and treatment days. Subjects will be
      instructed to finish all their meals within 25 minutes with no leftovers. Subjects will only
      consume foods served to them at planned meal and snack times.

      Two different full day menus of low nitrite/NDMA and high nitrite/NDMA meals have been
      developed. Additional details regarding the meals will be specified in the Meal Preparation
      Plan. Meals will be identical for treatments A and B (low nitrite/NDMA meal) of the study and
      a separate set of identical low nitrite/NDMA meals will be served on the washout days prior
      to treatment. Likewise, meals will be identical for treatments C and D (high nitrite/NDMA
      meal) and a separate set of identical high nitrite/NDMA meals will be served on the washout
      days prior to treatment. The last meal on Day -1, Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6 should be
      administered at approximately 18:00 to permit at least 12-hour fasting prior to dosing.
      Outside of meal times, subjects will be provided with distilled water to drink throughout the
      study.

      On study treatment days, the first meal will be provided at the time of dosing. Subjects will
      be instructed to swallow the medication with approximately 250 mL of room temperature
      distilled water and begin eating one minute after dosing. Subjects are required to eat each
      meal in its entirety during the study. If the meal is not finished, the reason should be
      recorded, along with what was not eaten, and a picture of the remaining food should be taken.

      Prior to and following study drug or placebo administration on Day 1, subjects will undergo
      assessments as described in the Schedule of Events. There will be one day of washout between
      periods. Participants will be confined in the study clinic from Day -2 until the morning of
      Day 8.

      During the screening visit, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure
      the subject is eligible for the study. Subjects will be shown the low and high nitrite/NDMA
      menus and informed that each meal in the menu must be finished in its entirety. The subject
      must agree to consume all planned meals in order to be eligible to participate. The informed
      consent form will be reviewed with the subject by a member of the study team and the subject
      will be encouraged to ask questions to ensure he or she has a good understanding of the
      study. If the subject is eligible and agrees to participate, the subject will be asked to
      sign the informed consent form before any study specific procedure is performed, including
      randomization. Results of all screening tests will be evaluated by the study
      clinician/investigator against the inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject
      eligibility. For subjects that are eligible, a molecular diagnostic test for severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be performed just before or at check-in.

      During the study, urine and blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments will occur before
      or after drug or placebo administration at the following timepoints:

        -  Urine samples will be collected using separate collection containers over 24 h.
           Collection times will occur at 0 (pre-dose), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24 h. Subjects will be
           instructed to void their bladder at each collection time and total weight of the sample
           will be recorded. If a subject must void their bladder at an unscheduled time, the
           unscheduled voids will be collected, and total weight of the unscheduled voiding will be
           recorded. The unscheduled voiding sample will be treated, analytically analyzed, and
           reported as part of scheduled sample collection for determining cumulative amounts of
           NDMA, ranitidine, and DMA excreted over 24 h.

        -  Plasma samples will be collected at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14,
           and 24 h post-dose.

      Subjects will be discharged from the study after completion of all study procedures. If a
      subject discontinues from the study prematurely, all procedures scheduled for the end of the
      study will be performed. Meals (timing and components), activity levels, and general
      conditions in the study clinic will be standardized to the extent possible on the treatment
      days.

      Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a refractive error correction procedure that helps
      eliminate or reduce the dependence on corrective lenses. An important aspect of PRK is
      post-operative pain management. Post-operative pain can be significant in the first three to
      five days and is typically controlled utilizing various modalities including narcotic pain
      medication. Simple observation suggests a difference in the post-operative pain levels of
      patients utilizing the more potent oxycodone- versus the less potent codeine-containing
      acetaminophen preparations. There have been no studies performed to explore any differences
      in perceived pain comparing these two medications when used following PRK. This study is
      designed to answer this question by means of a pain survey conducted in the first five days
      post-op. This may help better manage similar patients in the future.

      This will be a prospective pain assessment study utilizing a simple three question survey
      given to patients undergoing bilateral PRK. Following recruitment and enrollment (see section
      4.1 and 4.2 for recruitment and consent process), patients will be randomized to be
      prescribed either 1) Group 1: codeine 30mg/acetaminophen 300mg (standard of care dosage) or
      2) Group 2: oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325mg (standard of care dosage) post-operatively. All
      post-operative patients will receive standard bandage contact lenses and as needed tetracaine
      as per standard of care. Patients will be removed from the study if they take other non-study
      pain medications. They will be asked to record their pain levels four times daily as well as
      the number of as needed narcotic pain medication taken and the number of tetracaine drops
      used (to isolate a potential confounding pain control modality). Randomization will be
      performed with the aid of www.randomizer.org which will generate a randomized assignment to
      either group 1 or group 2.

      All PRK procedures will be performed per standard of care. The procedure will be performed by
      one of the 4 approved surgeons. All surgeons will use the same technique using either the
      VISX or the Allegretto laser machines. This technique will include use of a brush for
      mechanical removal of corneal epithelial cells. The surgeons will take note at this time of
      the relative adherence of the epithelium to the underlying tissue and grade the adherence on
      a scale of 0-4 (0=least adherent and 4=most adherent). In the data analysis, differences
      between surgeons and between operating platform (VISX vs Allegretto) will be compared to
      account for any possible bias in operating parameters.

      The survey will be worded as follows:

        1. ""Rate your eye pain or level of discomfort at 0800, 1200, 1600 and 2000. Please write
           the number closest to your response in the table below under the appropriate day and
           time.

        2. ""How many tablets of study-related pain medication did you take today in the AM/PM?""

        3. ""How many times did you use topical tetracaine today in the AM/PM?""

        4. ""Did you take any other non-study related pain medications?""

      Patients will be followed-up post-operatively as per standard of care. This includes
      follow-up visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Starting on
      post-operative day 1, the patients will be asked to record their pain levels using the pain
      survey at four hour intervals (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000). At the 1 week post-operative visit,
      the pain surveys will be collected from the patients. Visual acuity data will be extracted
      from all but the 12 month follow-up appointment and used as a secondary outcome to correlate
      any possible differences in pain scores to functional outcomes in terms of visual acuity.

      Favipiravir is a drug with a mechanism of action different from that of the existing
      influenza antiviral drugs and effective against all types and sub-types of human influenza A,
      B and C viruses in vitro, showing anti-viral activity against various influenza virus strains
      including avian and swine viruses. Favipiravir also has shown anti-viral activity even
      against amantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir-resistant influenza viruses in vitro. The
      mechanism of action of favipiravir is the selective inhibition of RNA polymerase by
      favipiravir ribosyl triphosphate formed by cellular enzymes in the influenza virus leading to
      antiviral activity.

      Feeding and oral motor interventions address different aspects of feeding difficulties,
      reflecting the range in specific problems associated with feeding and nutrition in CP.

      The trunk plays an important role in the organization of postural control and balance
      reactions because it holds the centre of all body mass and holds therefore, the centre of
      gravity. The trunk also provides stable attachment points to those muscles that control the
      head and neck regions. ""Neck and trunk stabilization exercises"" were the basis of static and
      dynamic balance abilities, and that increased neck and trunk stability might have had a
      positive effect thereon.

      To achieve the alignment of the head with the trunk, the pelvis must be stabilized. This has
      important consequences for the entire process of swallowing. If the head is not stable, then
      the fine movements of the jaw and tongue needed for feeding will be impaired. With feeding
      and oral motor interventions and structured neck and trunk stabilization exercises, these
      parameters are positively affected.

      The use of instructional technical surgical videos is common in orthopaedic education. Many
      residents have used instructional technical surgical training videos prior to medical school,
      as well as during their residency program, and at instructional courses. The use of
      instructional technical surgical videos and multimedia is considered an adjunctive training
      method for orthopaedic residents to learn operative procedures.

      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) is increasingly used in surgical education. Recently, iVR has
      shown transfer of skill training in orthopaedics. The continued study of the effectiveness of
      iVR training in orthopaedic education could benefit new competency based orthopaedics
      residency programs.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of instructional technical surgical
      video training to immersive iVR training for teaching technical skills of reverse total
      shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was that iVR improved learning effectiveness compared
      to standard technical surgical video. Secondary objectives include validating a virtual
      reality ratings scale through correlation to real-world performance.

      We proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial directly comparing immersive iVR
      versus technical surgical instructional video training in the teaching of reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty in senior residents, learning at the 2020 annual Canadian Shoulder and Elbow
      Society meeting.

      The use of instructional technical surgical videos is common in orthopaedic education. Many
      residents have used instructional technical surgical training videos prior to medical school,
      as well as during their residency program, and at instructional courses. The use of
      instructional technical surgical videos and multimedia is considered an adjunctive training
      method for orthopaedic residents to learn operative procedures.

      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) is increasingly used in surgical education. Recently, iVR has
      shown transfer of skill training in orthopaedics. The continued study of the effectiveness of
      iVR training in orthopaedic education could benefit new competency based orthopaedics
      residency programs.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of instructional technical surgical
      video training to immersive iVR training for teaching technical skills of reverse total
      shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was that iVR improved learning effectiveness compared
      to standard technical surgical video. Secondary objectives include validating a virtual
      reality ratings scale through correlation to real-world performance, and to determine
      efficiency of learning in both groups.

      Currently, technical surgical instructional videos are pervasive in orthopaedic teaching
      education. Immersive VR, another form of teaching, is increasingly being used in surgical
      education. The production of an immersive VR suite with tactile and user metric feedback may
      be an advance over current bench top simulator technology, allowing for greater immersion and
      interaction, leading to better understanding of surgical planning and implementation. The
      development of this technology could provide trainees with immersive levels of training not
      previously seen, with improved learning of technical skills over media such as manufacturer
      technical documents. The effectiveness of training and efficiency of training of the novel
      immersive VR training systems need to be evaluated as they are increasingly incorporated into
      competency based, contemporary residency education.

      We proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial directly comparing immersive iVR
      versus technical surgical instructional video training in the teaching of reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty in senior (fourth and fifth year) residents, learning at the 2020 annual
      Canadian Shoulder and Elbow Society meeting.

      Favipiravir is a drug with a mechanism of action different from that of the existing
      influenza antiviral drugs and effective against all types and sub-types of human influenza A,
      B and C viruses in vitro, showing anti-viral activity against various influenza virus strains
      including avian and swine viruses. Favipiravir also has shown anti-viral activity even
      against amantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir-resistant influenza viruses in vitro. The
      mechanism of action of favipiravir is the selective inhibition of RNA polymerase by
      favipiravir ribosyl triphosphate formed by cellular enzymes in the influenza virus leading to
      antiviral activity.

      The prone position strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is
      simple and cost-effective from the first description on its use in patients with acute
      respiratory failure to improve hypoxemia. Different studies have investigated its safety and
      efficacy in various clinical settings, demonstrating that its early use in combination with
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) or high-flow oxygen therapy can reduce intubation
      rate and mortality in ARDS. In the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, high-value
      medicine and resource optimization are critical.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has significantly challenged health
      systems worldwide. Due to the large number of infections around the world, the implementation
      of strategies to reduce the number of intubations and the need for invasive mechanical
      ventilation becomes important. In addition to the inability of the Mexican health system to
      respond, patients under invasive ventilation have not had a favorable survival outcome. Up to
      97% mortality has been reported in patients requiring intubation. The exact cause of this
      poor prognosis is not yet known. Early recognition of hypoxemic patients could help with the
      results. It seems reasonable in these patients to perform procedures to improve the clinical
      respiratory picture before intubation in less severe cases due to the aforementioned. Prone
      patient placement during invasive mechanical ventilation is a widespread practice in the
      management of severe ARDS of other etiologies. Currently, few attempts have been made to
      implement the prone position in patients who spontaneously ventilate with supplemental
      oxygen, high-flow nasal cannulas, or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Taking into account
      that it is a procedure that does not require additional infrastructure within the services
      and does not represent an additional cost for its implementation, it becomes a valuable tool
      in the context of COVID-19 where intubation is associated with high mortality and in a
      Additionally, there are mechanical ventilator deficits in most hospitals. This work has
      feasibility to be carried out because it will be carried out in critical areas that have

      Oral naltrexone was initially FDA approved to treat opioid use disorder and alcohol
      dependence at doses from 50-100mg/day. At lower doses of 1-5mg/day, naltrexone has been used
      off-label with success in treatment of several dermatologic conditions including the scarring
      hair loss disease lichen planopilaris. A recent case series of four patients with lichen
      planopilaris and a subtype, frontal fibrosing alopecia, treated with oral low-dose naltrexone
      at 3mg daily showed reduction of itch, clinical evidence of inflammation of the scalp, and of
      disease progression. There were no reported adverse events.

      Based on the promising evidence, we propose using low-dose naltrexone at a daily dose of 3mg
      to treat lichen planopilaris and frontal fibrosing alopecia. The patients would be continued
      on their other medications for these conditions. The study would be open-label, so all
      participants would receive the low-dose naltrexone. Patients would be seen at 0,3,6 and 12
      months to monitor their progress.

      Sedation is defined as the act of administrating a sedative drug to produce a state of calm
      or sleep. Sedation is commonly given to a patient in hospital settings to provide a tolerable
      and pleasant experience by relieving anxiety, pain and discomfort, as well as to expedite the
      duration of the procedure. Moderate sedation (conscious sedation) is the preferred state of
      sedation, whereby self-maintenance of ventilation and hemodynamic stability is achieved.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if inhalational Sevoflurane is a more
      superior sedative agent in terms of faster psychomotor recovery and time taken to fulfil
      discharge criteria when compared with intravenous Midazolam sedation.

      Secondary objective is to determine if inhalational Sevoflurane sedation has better patient's
      and endoscopist's satisfaction when compared with intravenous Midazolam sedation.

      University Malaya Medical Centre medical research ethics committee. All patients gave written
      and informed consent. Patients were fasted, and three psychometric tests were performed as a
      baseline before sedation. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive IV Midazolam
      (Group M) or inhalational Sevoflurane (Group S) via nasal mask. Standard monitoring was
      applied. Patients in Sevoflurane group received the inhalational agent via a nasal mask with
      stepwise increment until and Observed Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale of 3 or maximum
      1.0 minimum alveolar concentration was achieved. Patients in Midazolam group were given a
      stat dose of IV Midazolam 2.5mg. Both groups received 30mcg of IV Fentanyl and lignocaine 1%
      gargle prior to the procedure. The unblinded observer monitored the level of sedation and
      recorded the patient's vital signs. A second blinded observer performed the psychometric
      tests before and at the end of the procedure. He also recorded the time to fulfil discharge
      criteria as well as the satisfaction scores from the patient and endoscopist.

      The specific aim was to conduct a single dose, open-label, randomized, two period crossover
      pivotal study to determine the bioequivalence of two formulations containing haloperidol 2 mg
      in healthy males and females under fasting conditions

      A total of 32 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) were entered into
      the study. Volunteers were determined to be free of significant medical conditions as
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers were
      randomly allocated to a treatment sequence, before administration of investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) under fasting conditions.

      A wash-out period of at least 14 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of
      the analyte) between consecutive administrations of the IMP was maintained.

      Blood samples were collected at at pre-dose (0 hours), at 30 minutes, at 1 hour, 1 hour 30
      minutes, 2 hours, 2 hours 30 minutes, 3 hours, 3 hours 30 minutes, 4 hours, 4 hours 30

      The specific aim was to conduct a single dose, open-label, randomized, two period crossover
      pivotal study to determine the bioequivalence of two formulations containing haloperidol 2 mg
      in healthy males and females under fed conditions.

      A total of 32 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) were entered into
      the study. Volunteers were determined to be free of significant medical conditions as
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers were
      randomly allocated to a treatment sequence, before administration of investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) under fed conditions.

      A wash-out period of at least 14 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of
      the analyte) between consecutive administrations of the IMP was maintained.

      Blood samples were collected at at pre-dose (0 hours), at 30 minutes, at 1 hour,

      The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare workers physically and psychologically.
      Healthcare workers have ben required to work under stressful conditions and take difficult
      decisions involving ethical implications. Increasing work demands on healthcare professionals
      conflict with their duties to family and friends, which causes psychological stress. All of
      these factors may negatively affect their menstrual cycle.

      The aim of this study is to examine whether there is a change in menstrual cycle
      characteristics during pandemia. Second aim is to investigate whether there is an association
      between Covid 19 infection and menstrual cycle changes.

      This cross-sectional study is conducted with healthy female participants who are working at
      Haydarpasa Numune Research and Training Hospital in Turkey. The researcher investigates the
      characteristics of menstrual cycle in female healthy workers employed in Covid 19 pandemic
      inpatient and outpatient clinics. The participants who are sure about their pertinent
      information are enrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria includes pregnancy, history of
      hysterectomy, oophorectomy, diseases like Asherman's syndrome and also history of endocrine
      disorders (progesterone deficiency, thyroid disorders and diabetes mellitus), oral
      contraceptive use, malignancy, primary amenorrhea, menopause and lactation.

      After informed consent, detailed information is collected using structured questionnaires
      about their reproductive factors and menstrual cycles by direct interviews. The questionnaire
      contains questions about age, work experience, marital status, height, weight, working hours,
      use of medication, menstrual cycle characteristics (including cycle duration, duration and
      amount of bleeding, bleeding during the cycle, regular or irregular menstrual cycles) and
      dysmenorrhea. Also, the difference in menstrual cycle characteristics between covid positive
      and negative healthcare professionals is investigated.

      The study consists of 4 phases - screening & baseline assessment, eating condition 1,
      wash-out period, and eating condition 2. Before and after each phase participants will
      complete a 28-hour inpatient assessment at the Clinical and Translational Research Center
      (CTRC) of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania to study the impact of one's eating
      on body weight and fat content, metabolism, and certain markers of metabolism in the blood.

      Screening In order to participate in this study the participants must undergo a complete
      physical examination and tests of blood and urine. These tests will determine if participants
      have any conditions that would prevent them from participating in the study, including
      diabetes or any serious uncontrolled medical condition that may interfere with their
      participation in the study. Other conditions that would prevent them from taking part are
      pregnancy or nursing, a sleep disorder, the use of certain medications, or night-shift work.
      A urine pregnancy test will be given to women at this screening visit.

      Participants will also complete several surveys of a psychological nature and participate in
      a clinical interview. Sleep and exercise schedules are important and will be reviewed during
      their visits to see if they match with the study requirements. During the 10 days of the
      screening assessment, participants will keep a log in which they will record all food and
      beverages that they consume. They will also use these logs to record when they sleep and
      exercise. Their activity will be measured by a small electronic wrist activity recorder,
      called an Actigraph (about the size of a wrist watch), during this time. This recorder,
      similar to a pedometer, records all activity from the arm, and is very useful in determining
      if and when they get up at night. Study staff will explain how to keep this information
      during the baseline visit. They will return the activity recorder and log to Dr. Allison for
      analysis at the end of the 10-days. They are expected to return all study materials,
      including the Actigraph, log, and questionnaires.

      Assessments Following successful completion of the screening period, they will complete the
      first of four assessment visits. This visit will include 28 hours (overnight) spent at the
      CTRC, where their meals and snacks will be provided.

      They will arrive at the CTRC at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania at 7 AM.
      Starting at 8 AM, their blood will be drawn every four hours. A thin needle (an introducer)
      will be inserted into a vein in their forearm, much like an IV line. Very small blood
      samples, 10mL (2 teaspoonfuls), will be collected every four hours from 8:00 AM on Day 1
      through 8:00 AM on Day 2. From this blood study staff will measure hormones related to
      metabolism, sleep, and stress. They will be provided meals and snacks during this time, and
      they are free to watch television or use their computer or participate in other sedentary
      pastimes while they are there.

      After the blood draws end at 8 AM on the second morning, their metabolic rate will be
      measured. Participants will be asked to fast for 10 hours overnight (they will not be able to
      eat or drink anything except water for 10 hours starting at 10 PM the night before). Then
      study staff will measure their resting metabolic rate for 20 minutes. During the
      measurements, they will lay on their back in bed with a plastic hood/canopy over their head
      and neck. They will lay still and breathe normally while the air they inhale and exhale is
      collected in the canopy/hood and analyzed using a machine that is connected to the
      canopy/hood.

      Participants will be discharged from the hospital, and research staff will escort them to the
      Center for Weight and Eating Disorders where their body composition will be measured using
      dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). During this test, X-ray pictures of their body will
      measure how much fat and muscle are present. They will lie flat on a table and a machine will
      take pictures of different areas of the body. This test will last about 30 minutes. This will
      conclude the assessment visit.

      Eating Conditions & Assessments Upon completion of the baseline assessment, participants will
      be randomly assigned to start with one of two eating conditions: 1) Daytime or 2) Delayed,
      and then they will switch and eat on the other schedule for the final part of the study. If
      they are assigned to the Daytime eating condition first, they will be asked to consume all of
      their meals and snacks each day between 8 AM and 7 PM. If they are assigned to the Delayed
      eating condition first, they will be asked to consume all of their meals and snacks between
      12 PM and 11 PM each day. They will eat on these schedules for 8 weeks each.

      During the two 8-week eating condition periods, all of their meals and snacks will be
      provided by the research kitchen and will be delivered to themby a member of the research
      staff twice per week. They will be provided a personalized menu and asked to track each food
      item they consume. They will also be asked to record any beverages they consume on this menu
      (beverages will not be provided). If occasionally they do not eat the meals provided, they
      will be asked to use their smart phone or electronic device to send a picture of their food
      to the study team before they eat it, and again if any food is not eaten when they have
      finished their meal. They will be asked to wear an Actigraph for the duration of the study,
      and study staff will deliver new devices and collect used devices one time per week. They
      will be sent and asked to respond to daily queries by text message or email regarding their
      eating, sleeping, and exercise. At the end of the 8 weeks, they will complete the second
      overnight assessment visit (as described above).

      For two weeks following this second assessment, they will be asked to eat as they normally
      would. During this ""wash-out"" period they will eat what and when then would like. They will
      then complete the third overnight assessment visit before starting the second eating
      condition (Delayed for those initially assigned to the Daytime schedule; Daytime for those
      initially assigned to the Delayed schedule). They will be asked to eat on this new schedule

      Saline infusion sonography (SIS) and hysteroscopy are commonly employed methods for uterine
      cavity evaluation. While hysteroscopy is regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis of
      intra-uterine pathology, it is not often used as an initial screening tool because of
      provider concerns about in-office tolerability, operating room costs, and use of anesthesia.
      The investigators aim to compare SIS and office hysteroscopy with respect to patient and
      provider satisfaction. Additionally, the investigators aim to assess the capability of
      office-based hysteroscopy to manage intra-uterine pathology at the time of diagnosis and
      reduce delays and supernumerary procedures.

      Saline infusion sonography (SIS) and hysteroscopy are commonly employed methods for uterine
      cavity evaluation. SIS is often performed as a screening tool in the office for uterine
      evaluation since it is straight-forward to perform, well-tolerated has low overhead cost. If
      uterine pathology is suspected on SIS, subsequent hysteroscopy is typically performed in the
      operating room. Hysteroscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of intra-uterine
      pathology and offers the opportunity for intervention at time of diagnosis, but often is not
      used as the initial screening tool because of provider concerns about in-office tolerability,
      equipment cost and maintenance. Technology advancements, however, has introduced an
      affordable, disposable, small caliber hysteroscopes with an operative channel to make it
      possible for this type of assessment to be performed in the office setting with the addition
      of a 'see and treat' modality. If used to perform initial uterine cavity evaluation,
      hysteroscopy may offer expedited diagnosis, treatment, and avoidance of general anesthesia.
      If superior specificity is demonstrated, it may also lower the false positive rate,
      preventing unnecessary delays to a patient's projected treatment plan, and unnecessary
      exposure to anesthesia risks. To date, no randomized control trials have compared the
      satisfaction of patients and providers to saline infusion sonography versus office
      hysteroscopy without anesthesia in initial cavity evaluation with the ability to immediately
      address intra-uterine pathology.

      NLR has previously been observed to correlate with complications in upper GI (1) and
      colorectal (2) surgery. The investigators sought to assess if a similar correlation can be
      identified in emergency general surgical patients and if the presence of suspected or
      confirmed COVID-19 may impact on this.

      Given the heterogeneity of emergency general surgery the investigators therefore plan to
      perform a retrospective review of patients having emergency laparotomies only at a single NHS
      site during COVID-19 pandemic. Assessment of outcomes and Neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio as a
      predictor of outcomes will be completed. Outcomes will be completed in line with the recent
      COVIDSurg study criteria (3). The primary outcome is 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes are
      7-day mortality, re-operation, length of stay, post-operative respiratory failure,

      Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a common, huge health and socioeconomic health problem
      that affects physiological functions and reduces work efficiency in nurses.

      Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of low-level laser acupuncture combined
      with acupressure (LAA) on pain intensity, pain interference and life dysfunction in hospital
      nurses with LBP.

      Methods: This single-blinded randomized controlled trial enrolled a convenience sample of
      nurses from one teaching hospital. Seventy-six participants were randomly assigned to the LAA
      group (n=38) receiving low-level laser acupuncture and auricular acupressure for four weeks,
      and a control group (n=38) receiving a similar intervention but without laser energy and
      acupressure. Data were collected using the Short Form of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-SF)
      and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) at three time points: baseline before the

      In patients in Group K, fingertip saturation was targeted as 93% and above, and a COT was
      applied with a reservoir mask with a flow rate of 6-15 l / min.

      The flow rate was calculated using the formula of FiO2 (%) = 21 + 4 * (liters / min) in
      patients undergoing COT. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was applied to patients who could
      not be provided with adequate clinical and laboratory well-being in both groups (partial
      oxygen pressure / fraction of inspired oxygen ratio below 150) and invasive mechanical
      ventilation if this was insufficient.

      Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus infections
      is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease.

      It is estimated that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible interval (CI):
      82-90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented
      infections per person was 55% the transmission rate of documented infections (95% CI:
      46-62%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of
      79% of the documented cases.

      Ivermectin + Carrageenan, taking advantage of their virucidal effects, are aimed at reducing
      the contagion.

      CONTAGION COURSE Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel
      coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic
      potential of this disease.

      Observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a
      networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical
      epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of
      undocumented infections and their contagiousness, have been attempted. The rapid geographic
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly
      challenging.

      DISSEMINATION BY DROPLETS For COVID-19, the salivary gland could be an important source of
      the virus in saliva and would generate infectious saliva on a sustained basis.

      ACE2 expression in the minor salivary glands was higher than in the lungs, suggesting that
      the salivary glands is a potential target for COVID-19.

      The positive rate of COVID-19 in the patients' saliva can reach 91.7%, and the saliva samples
      can also culture the live virus.

      In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the
      Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6
      feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we
      usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies
      support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person.
      Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared
      with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and
      that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed,
      there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to
      its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available
      knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing
      the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission
      sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out
      inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the
      hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has
      to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in
      analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th,
      we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional
      factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of
      the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM)
      concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis
      of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than
      two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an
      effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.

      IVERMECTIN CONCENTRATION IN SALIVARY GLANDS The concentration of ivermectin was tested in
      different tissues, in different studies, both in animals and human beings. The concentration
      in salivary glands proved to be adequately acceptable.

      CARRAGEENAN VIRUCIDAL EFFECTS Iota Carrageenan is widely used in gastronomic, cosmetic and
      pharmacologic industry.

      Recently, its intrinsic virucidal effectas were proved over a variety of virus (herpes
      simplex, Japanese Encephalitis, Rhinovirus, etc.).

      Its mechanism of action is preventing virus adsorption to host cells. By applying both drugs
      topically, 5 times per day, in nasal and oral mucosae, we try to reduce contagion.
