          "BriefSummary":"Episodic and disjointed medical care for older, community-dwelling adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) leave them vulnerable to adverse events such as worsening disease trajectories, frequent emergency department (ED) utilization, and avoidable hospital admissions. It is imperative that an alternative means of health delivery be developed, establishing a coordinated, flexible care model to connect patients with the appropriate resources to address their acute needs and integrate with their medical homes to navigate fraught moments in their disease management.\n\nThe Mobile integrated health (MIH) care delivery model may offer a solution by providing flexible and innovative on-demand care in the comfort of patients' homes. The MIH paradigm expands the use of highly trained paramedics outside of their traditional EMS role, by dispatching them into the community to perform in-home medical evaluations and treatment(s) in consultation with an actively involved, remotely located, supervising physician. These \"community paramedics\" evaluate patients and render care using mobile diagnostics and a variety of medications, allowing patients to remain in place until they can be evaluated definitively on an ambulatory basis.\n\nUtilizing a model of on-demand community paramedic visits paired with a telehealth consultation with a physician, this intervention will manage patients in place until they can access planned ambulatory follow up, decreasing the use of prehospital emergency transport services, emergency department utilizations, and hospital admissions as well as limiting transitions of care and allowing ambulatory providers to maintain longitudinal oversight of disease management\n\nThe objective of this project is to study the feasibility of the refined MIH model for the care of community dwelling patients with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We will conduct a small pre/post pilot intervention trial enrolling 50 patients into a pilot MIH program. Primary outcomes will include participant satisfaction, patient activation, and subject retention. We will also collect outcomes data including ED visits, hospitalizations, and hospital lengths of stay."
