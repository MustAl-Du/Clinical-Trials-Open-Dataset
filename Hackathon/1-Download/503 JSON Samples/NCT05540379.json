          "DetailedDescription":"Diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy is one of the most common surgical intervention in gynecological surgery. In recent years, it has acquired a central role in diagnosis and treatment of a variety of uterine pathologies like fibroids, polyps and uterine malformations It is also pivotal in the management of primary or secondary infertility. Biopsy specimens are also sampled with hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.\n\nIn recent years, the technological advancements such as the use of small diameter (3,5mm) rigid hysteroscopes combined with \"no touch\" techniques have made hysteroscopy a commonly accepted procedure .\n\nAs a minimally invasive procedure, hysteroscopy is associated with fewer complications than traditional open surgery However, it is challenging to gain manual dexterity in hysteroscopy because of the fulcrum effect and the orientation between the two-dimensional screen and the three-dimensional uterine cavity. Other difficulties are the diminished tactile feedback and limited degrees of freedom, . Lack of proficiency in hysteroscopy can compromise patient safety by causing uterine perforation and trauma to neighboring organs. Also, pulmonary air embolisms and pulmonary edema are potential life-threatening complications.\n\nToday it is generally accepted that the traditional apprentice-tutor model is no longer valid for training all skills necessary in Gynecological surgery and more specifically endoscopic surgery This agreement is based on the recognition that, in contrast to open surgery, endoscopic surgery demands surgical skills and psychomotor skills that should not necessarily be trained simultaneously. Increasing evidence strongly suggests that psychomotor skills must be trained earlier and outside the operating room, and several models have been proposed for this aim"
