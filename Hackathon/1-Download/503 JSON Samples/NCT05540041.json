          "BriefSummary":"It is emphasized in studies that child and parent anxiety that arises in pediatric surgery should be prevented or reduced. According to previous studies, one way to reduce child and parent anxiety in the preoperative period is therapeutic play interventions. This study was planned to compare the effectiveness of two different therapeutic play interventions (bubble breathing play therapy and tell-show-do play therapy) in reducing preoperative anxiety of children and parents who are scheduled for elective surgery.",
          "DetailedDescription":"Aim: This study was planned to comparison of the effectiveness of two different therapeutic play interventions (bubble breathing play therapy and tell-show-do play therapy) in reducing preoperative anxiety of children and parents who are scheduled for elective surgery.\n\nMethod: This study was planned as a randomized controlled trial. The sample of the study will consist of 105 children aged 5-12, who will be operated on at Akdeniz University Hospital, and their parents. Randomization result; It was planned to include a total of 105 children and their parents in 3 groups: bubble breathing play therapy group (intervention group 1)= 35, tell-show-do play therapy group (intervention group 2)= 35 , and control group= 35 children and parents.\n\nChild and parent information form will be used to collect data, Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale will be used to collect data in child sample, and Spielberger State Anxiety Scale will be used to collect data in parent sample.\n\nIntervention and Data Collection: Randomization will be performed after the purpose of the study is explained to the child and parent who agreed to participate in the study and after obtaining consent. Immediately after the pretest (first measurement) is given to the children assigned to intervention group 1 and their parents, attempts to bubble breathing play therapy will be applied for 5-10 minutes. If they wish, the child and parents will be told that they can continue to play with the bubble toys until premedication. Children assigned to intervention group 2 and their parents will be tell-show-do play therapy for 10-15 minutes immediately after the pre-test (first measurement) is done. Participants randomized to the control group will be given routine standard nursing care. The second measurement will be just before premedication (post test). Thus, the effectiveness of the initiatives and their comparison with each other will be evaluated.\n\nThe data of the research will be analyzed using the Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) 23.0 software package program. The process of evaluating the data will be carried out with the support of a statistician."
