If the target lesion is < 70% stenosed, there should be clinical evidence of ischemia such as a positive functional study (e.g. exercise treadmill test, thallium stress test, SPECT, or stress echo), cardiac computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography, fractional flow reserve, or post infarct angina.\nTarget lesion must have a Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow â‰¥1\n\nClinical Exclusion Criteria:\n\nSubject is pregnant and/or breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant during the duration of the study\nSubject has clinical symptoms and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with STEMI within 72 hours prior to the index procedure.

Prior PCI within a non-target vessel or any peripheral intervention is acceptable if performed anytime > 30 days before the index procedure\nSubject requires future peripheral interventions < 30 days after the index procedure unless DAPT regimen can be maintained.\nSubject is on dialysis or impaired renal function (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl or 221 Î¼mol/L, determined within 72 hours prior to the index procedure)\nAllergic reaction, hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin; or to clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor or ticlopidine; or to heparin and bivalirudin; contrast media that cannot be resolved with pre-medication; sirolimus, everolimus, or similar limus drugs; poly L-lactide, or the scaffold material (magnesium, aluminum) or Xience stent (cobalt, chromium, tungsten, nickel, fluorinated copolymer).\nSubject is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., inhaled steroids are not excluded) or has known life-limiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not including diabetes mellitus)\nLife expectancy less than 1 year\nPlanned surgery or dental surgical procedure within 6 months after index procedure, unless DAPT can be maintained\nIn the investigator's opinion subject will not be able to comply with the follow-up requirements\nSubjects under oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC) prior to index procedure unless DAPT + OAC (i.e. triple therapy) can be maintained for a minimum of 6 months If a subject requires OAC after the index procedure, DAPT should be maintained until 6 months after the index procedure. Afterwards DAPT can be limited to either aspirin or clopidogrel (or prasugrel, ticagrelor or ticlopidine) alone together with OAC for the remaining time up to 12 months. After this, OAC monotherapy can be prescribed if still required.\n\nAngiographic Exclusion Criteria:\n\nTarget vessel has been previously treated and the target lesion is within 5 mm proximal or distal to the previously treated lesion\nLeft main coronary artery disease\nTarget lesion is totally occluded (100% stenosis)\nThrombus in target vessel\nSubject is currently participating in another study with an investigational device or an investigational drug and has not reached the primary endpoint yet\nFuture planned staged PCI either in target or non-target vessel\nOstial target lesion (within 5.0 mm of vessel origin)\nTarget lesion involves a side branch that requires a 2-device strategy\nTarget lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft\nThe target lesion requires treatment with a device other than the pre-dilatation balloon or scoring balloon prior to scaffold/stent placement (including but not limited to drug-coated balloons, atherectomy devices, intravascular lithotripsy, etc.)\nTarget vessel was treated with brachytherapy any time prior to the index procedure\nUnsuccessful pre-dilatation, defined as residual stenosis rate more than 20% (by visual estimation) and / or angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure, flow-limiting dissections)\nStenosis located proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require future revascularization or impede run off detected during diagnostic angiography",
