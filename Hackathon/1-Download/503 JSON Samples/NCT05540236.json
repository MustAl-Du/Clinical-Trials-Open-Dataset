          "BriefSummary":"Auricular acupressure is easily accessible and easily performed, and can significantly relieve PONV symptoms, and improve patient's satisfaction in women receiving general anesthesia for gynecological surgeries. This makes it an economically-beneficial supplemental therapy, worthy of promoting for patients receiving general anesthesia.",
          "DetailedDescription":"Background: Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common after surgery and anesthesia. Studies have indicated that females receiving gynecological surgeries have a higher incidence of PONV compared to other surgical patients. PONV not only causes discomfort, but may also lead to serious complications, affecting health outcomes. Currently, no single medication has shown universal efficacy for the prevention and treatment of PONV, thus it is empirical for the exploration of non-pharmaceutical methods for PONV management.\n\nPurposes: The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of auricular acupressure on the reduction of PONV, post-operative anxiety, vital signs stability (respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure), and overall improvement of patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods: This study design was a randomized clinical trial, with the study population of patients with gynecological laparoscopic surgeries between the ages of 20 to 50, receiving general anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery. A total of 82 patients were enrolled, who were randomly allocated into the control and experimental groups using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software, with 40 patients in each group, after 2 patients were excluded. Demographic Survey and Hospital Anxiety Scale (Anxiety- HADS-A) were completed prior to surgery. Both group of patients received the auricular pellet acupressure after the first measurement of vital signs upon entry into the post-anesthesia care unit. The control group were given sham intervention of single ear auricular pellet acupressure at the knee(AH4) and thoracic vertebrae(AH11) acupuncture points, while the experimental group were given therapeutic intervention of single ear auricular pellet acupressure at the stomach(CO4), cardia(CO3), liver(CO12), occiput(AT3), shenmen(TF4) and subcortex(AT4) acupuncture points. The Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching (INVR) and vital signs were surveyed 8 hours after surgery. The same was process was repeated 24 hours after surgery, along with Hospital Anxiety Scale (Anxiety- HADS-A) and anesthesia satisfaction surveys. The auricular acupressure were removed after 24 hours. Data was processed using SPSS version 26.0 statistical analysis package software, using independent samples t-test and chi-square test to identify differences between the two groups, and perform post-interventional effectiveness analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE)."

The higher the total score, the more severe the symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha of the original tool is 0.89-0.97, the Cronbach's alpha of prospective studies was 0.85 (Rhodes & McDaniel, 1999), while the Cronbach's alpha of Chou et al. (2005) for the Chinese version of the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching(RINV) was 0.94, with content validity index (CVI) of 1.0.",

In the UK and other European countries, many studies show that the Cronbach's alpha for cancer patients was 0.81-0.90. Domestically, Chen et al.'s use of the Chinese version showed Cronbach's alpha of 0.82 for the anxiety assessment tool (HADS-A) and 0.77 for the depression assessment tool (HADS-D), with retest reliability of r = 0.64-0.83（p<0.0l）one week afterwards. Using the 4-Point Likert Scale to evaluate anxiety and depression, the two assessment tools score 0-21 points, with higher points indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression.
