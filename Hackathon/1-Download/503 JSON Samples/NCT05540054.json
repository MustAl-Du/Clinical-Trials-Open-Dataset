Patients with a diagnosis of COPD, who are listed for a bronchoscopic procedure and referred to the pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) clinic, will be randomly divided into two groups. Standard PR exercise program will be applied to both groups. In addition to the standard program, IMT will be applied to one of the groups. The effect of IMT on exercise program gains will be examined.",
          "DetailedDescription":"Cases diagnosed with COPD by a chest diseases specialist at Yedikule Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and Research Hospital will be included in the study.\nThe cases meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized and divided into two groups, called the standard rehabilitation group (PRGr) and the inspiratory muscle training group (IMTGr).\nInitial exercise sessions and all evaluations of all cases will be performed in the hospital. The 2nd and 3rd training repetitions will be held at their homes via online synchronized videoconferencing. The exercise video will be sent to the smart phones of the cases who have completed 3 training sessions. Participants will be called once a week by phone and exercise follow-up will be carried out.\nAll subjects will continue to exercise 5 days a week for 2 months. The standard PR consists of breathing exercises, peripheral muscle strength and self walking training. In addition, IMT was applied to IMTGr."
