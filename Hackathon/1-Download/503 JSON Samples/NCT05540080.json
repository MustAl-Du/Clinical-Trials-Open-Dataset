The study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a single study group. Subjects will be required to complete four (4) treatment visits and two follow-up visits. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject device.",
          "DetailedDescription":"At the baseline visit, MRI imaging will be performed; the subject's weight and waist circumference will be recorded. Digital photographs of the treated area will be taken.\n\nThe treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments, delivered 5-10 days apart. The applicators of BTL-899 will be applied over the area of flanks. The device will induce visible muscle contractions along with heating of the subcutaneous fat. Each therapy session will last 30 minutes.\n\nAt the last therapy visit, the subject's weight and waist circumference will be recorded, and digital photographs of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will receive Therapy Comfort and Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire to fill in.\n\nSafety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE), which will be assessed after each procedure and at all of the follow-up visits."
