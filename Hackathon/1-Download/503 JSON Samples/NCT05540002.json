Patients will attend two quantitative sensory testing visits in order to determine their level of pain sensitivity, one at the beginning of the study and the second at the 3-month follow-up session. Subjects will be asked to test out the Quell device to see if they can tolerate the sensation, and will then be randomized into one of the two treatment groups: the High Intensity Quell group or the Low Intensity Quell group. Participants will be asked to wear the device for at least 3 hours every day. They will be asked to complete daily assessments, along with a total of three sets of questionnaires, one at the start of the study, the second 6 weeks from the date of consent, and the third 3 months after the date of consent. We will also call participants once a week for a brief phone interview throughout the study. Participants will be in this study for 3 months."
