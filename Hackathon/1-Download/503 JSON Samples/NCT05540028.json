Adult subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either IVT PCV-25 or Prevnar 20™, and the young children subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either IVT PCV-25 or Prevnar 13®. The infant subjects will receive a series of four vaccinations with IVT-PCV-25 at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age co-administered with all routine vaccines except for Prevnar 13. The three age-group cohorts will be conducted sequentially to allow for safety and tolerability assessment of IVT PCV 25 in adults prior to age de-escalation to children, and for assessment of immunogenicity in adults, and safety and tolerability in children, prior to age de-escalation to infants."
