          "BriefSummary":"A comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the erbium laser with the wavelength of 2.94 µm and traditional instruments in the extraction of the impacted lower third molars will be performed. Clinical, radiological and biochemical findings will be assessed after extraction of the impacted lower third molars.",
          "DetailedDescription":"A single-centre, interventional, non-randomized, prospective clinical trial in 2 parallel groups is planned. The lower third molars will be extracted in 60 patients. There will be 2 groups. The number of men and women in both groups will be the same, the patients age will be between 18 and 70 years. In the study group the lower third molars will be extracted using erbium laser with a wavelength of 2.94 µm (Erbium laser Smart 2940D plus with the wavelength 2,94 µm, company- DEKA, Italy, registration № 2005/1245), in the control group the lower third molars will be extracted using the conventional method (cutting and rotating instruments). Postoperative clinical symptoms such as collateral soft tissue swelling, postoperative pain, trismus in the extraction site and healing time (epithelization and bone regeneration) will be assessed. The epithelization will be assessed after 7, 10, 14 days. The bone regeneration will be assessed by cone beam computed tomography (KAVO, ORTHOPANTOMOGRAPH ОР 3D, type: РСХ-1; registration № РЗН 2020/10586) after 1, 3, 6 months. The radiation exposure will not exceed the permissible limits. Biochemical indicators in the saliva will be assessed before extraction, after extraction, 3 days and 7 days after the extraction. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be applied to check the normality of variable distribu- tion. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by Pearson's chi-squared test. Quantitative variables (normal distribution of variable) will be analyzed by Students t-test, non-normal distribution of variables will be analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test."
