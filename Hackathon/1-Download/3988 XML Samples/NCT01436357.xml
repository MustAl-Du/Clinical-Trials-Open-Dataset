  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two stage, phase I/II, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV)uninfected male and female injection drug users (IDU) aged 18 to 45. AdCh3NSmut1&#xD;
      and MVA-NSMut HCV vaccine will be administered to 68 (+/-4) volunteers in stage 1. A planned&#xD;
      interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity will be conducted. If no safety signal is&#xD;
      detected and there is evidence of a measurable immune response to HCV then 472 (+/-4)&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled in stage 2. Primary objectives are to 1) assess the safety of&#xD;
      AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut compared to placebo when administered to HCV-uninfected IDUs and 2)&#xD;
      determine if AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut HCV vaccines will reduce incidence of chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection compared to placebo among HCV-uninfected IDUs. Planned study duration is approx 63&#xD;
      months (accrual time, 2 months vaccination, 18 months follow-up, and 9 months extended&#xD;
      observation for subjects becoming viremic in the last month of follow-up).&#xD;

      A two stage, phase I/II, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV)uninfected male and female injection drug users (IDU) aged 18 to 45. In this&#xD;
      clinical trial AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSMut HCV vaccine will be administered intramuscularly to&#xD;
      68 (+/-4) evaluable volunteers in stage 1. A planned interim analysis of safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity will be conducted based on data through 1 week after receipt of the second&#xD;
      vaccination. If no safety signal is detected and there is evidence of a measurable immune&#xD;
      response to HCV then an additional 472 (+/-4) volunteers will be enrolled in stage 2. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study will be 1) to assess the safety of the new candidate&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus vaccines, AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut, compared to placebo when administered&#xD;
      to HCV-uninfected injection drug users (IDUs) and 2) to determine if AdCh3NSmut1 and&#xD;
      MVA-NSmut HCV vaccines will reduce incidence of chronic HCV infection compared to placebo&#xD;
      among HCV-uninfected IDUs. The secondary objective of this study will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the new candidate hepatitis C virus vaccines, AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut,&#xD;
      compared to placebo when administered to HCV-uninfected IDUs.The planned duration of the&#xD;
      study is approximately 63 months total including accrual time for subjects (assuming 31&#xD;
      months of screening/enrollments, plus 3 months of halted enrollment for the first interim&#xD;
      analysis), 2 months vaccination, 18 months follow-up of each enrolled subject, and 9 months&#xD;
      extended observation (monthly), from the time of infection, for subjects becoming viremic in&#xD;
      the last month of follow-up.&#xD;

        study vaccine. If she later returns to clinic and reports having a negative home urine&#xD;
        pregnancy test and this is confirmed by a negative in clinic urine pregnancy test and a&#xD;
        negative blood pregnancy test she may be eligible for the second vaccination if she is&#xD;
        still within the vaccination window and no other exclusion criteria are met. The following&#xD;
        adverse events constitute contraindications to administration of vaccine at that point in&#xD;
        time. If any one of these adverse events occurs at the time scheduled for vaccination, the&#xD;
        subject may be vaccinated at a later date (within 28 days of scheduled administration) or&#xD;
        withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator. The subject will not receive additional&#xD;
        vaccination, but will continue with all scheduled follow-up procedures except vaccination.&#xD;
        3. Acute disease at the time of vaccination (acute disease is defined as the presence of a&#xD;
        moderate or severe illness with or without fever). The vaccine dose can be administered to&#xD;
        persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or&#xD;
        without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., temperature of &lt;38°C (100.4°F). 4. Temperature of&#xD;
        &gt;38°C (100.4°F) at the time of vaccination. 5. Immunization against another pathogen within&#xD;
        14 days of vaccination&#xD;

          <description>The IL28B gene is involved in the immune response to certain viruses, including hepatitis C. There are three IL28B subtypes (called genotypes): CC, CT, and TT. People with the CC genotype have a more potent immune response to HCV infection than people with the CT or TT genotypes (called non-CC genotypes). This immune response makes people who have a CC genotype more likely to clear HCV without treatment (called spontaneous viral clearance), within months of becoming infected. Given the impact of this gene, subjects were stratified based on having CC on non-CC genotypes.</description>
