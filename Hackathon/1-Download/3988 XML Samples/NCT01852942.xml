  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to test the hypothesis that treatment of HIV infected subjects with&#xD;
      losartan, an agent with specific anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions, will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reverse existing lymphoid tissue fibrosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. restore lymphoid tissue architecture,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. increase the number and improve the function of peripheral and lymphatic CD4 T cells,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. decrease levels of systemic immune activation (IA),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. decrease size of the HIV reservoir, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 50 HIV-1 infected individuals&#xD;
      on stable ART randomized in a 1:1 ratio to losartan (50 mg orally daily titrated to 100 mg&#xD;
      daily) vs placebo for 30 months. We plan to enroll a total of 63 HIV infected subjects to&#xD;
      ensure that 50 complete the protocol. All HIV infected subjects will undergo biopsies of&#xD;
      inguinal lymph node (LN) and gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) for primary endpoint&#xD;
      analysis at baseline, 12 and 30 months after study enrollment. Blood will be collected at&#xD;
      least quarterly throughout the study and an intensive blood pharmacokinetic (PK) study will&#xD;
      be conducted at month 1. All HIV infected subjects will be vaccinated with the quadrivalent&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine at months 23, 25 and 29.5 to measure immune function. 5&#xD;
      HIV uninfected control subjects will also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to determine the impact of losartan on lymphoid tissue fibrosis in&#xD;
      HIV infected, ART treated adults. This will be determined by measuring the amount of collagen&#xD;
      deposition in lymphoid tissues and the integrity of the FRCn using immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
      and quantitative image analysis (QIA).&#xD;
