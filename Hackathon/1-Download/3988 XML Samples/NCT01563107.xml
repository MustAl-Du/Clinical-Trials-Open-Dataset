  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) may not adequately expand their plasma&#xD;
      volume in response to a high sodium diet. Mechanisms involved in the regulation of plasma&#xD;
      volume, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal dopamine (DA), may be&#xD;
      impaired in POTS and may respond inappropriately to changes in dietary sodium. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that the changes in urinary sodium and dopamine excretion caused by&#xD;
      consuming low-sodium and high-sodium diets will be different between patients with POTS and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. The purpose of this study is to determine (1) whether changes in dietary&#xD;
      sodium level appropriately influence sodium excretion in POTS; (2) whether changes in dietary&#xD;
      sodium level appropriately influence DA excretion in POTS; (3) whether a high dietary sodium&#xD;
      level appropriately expands plasma volume in POTS; and (4) whether patients with POTS have&#xD;
      improvements in their orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms as a result of a high dietary&#xD;
      sodium level.&#xD;

      Study Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start 150 mEq Na+/day diet (POTS patients as inpatients; healthy control subjects with&#xD;
           Clinical Research Center(CRC)- provided outpatient diet); consume 1.5-2 liters of water&#xD;
           per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start a 24hour (24hr) urine collection (for sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), creatinine&#xD;
           (Cr), fractionated catecholamines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Days 2-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue 24hr urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start STUDY DIET (10 mEq Na+/day or 300 mEq Na+/day in a random order) after 3 meals of&#xD;
           150 mEq Na+/day are complete; consume 1.5-2 liters of water per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 5, a 24 hr Holter combined ECG monitor and BP monitor will be placed on the&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue STUDY DIET; consume 1.5-2 liters of water per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove 24hr Holter combined ECG monitor and BP monitor from subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue 24hr urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admit to CRC in afternoon (healthy control subjects only, as POTS patients will have&#xD;
           already been admitted). Each subject will spend the night in the CRC and remain supine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight for study next day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Awaken early (~6am) to void (still collecting 24hr urine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient returns to bed, IV catheter inserted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posture Study (in morning; between 7-8am ideally)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured while supine and then while standing for&#xD;
           up to 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will draw blood in each body position to measure electrolytes and hormones that&#xD;
           regulate blood pressure and blood volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will rate symptoms during supine period and at end of stand using Vanderbilt&#xD;
           Orthostatic Symptoms Score (VOSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total Blood Volume (DAXOR)- using injection of iodinated I-131 tagged human serum&#xD;
           albumin nominally 25 micro-Ci of radiation blood samples drawn through IV catheter&#xD;
           before injection and for ~30 minutes post-injection (total - 25 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be done after supine assessment, but before standing the subject up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Capacity Test (in the afternoon) Will estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2&#xD;
           max). This test will be conducted on a stationary bicycle. Effort will be gradually&#xD;
           increased while expired air is measured during exhaustive physical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are repeated at least a month later with the 2nd level of dietary salt.&#xD;
      (Randomized to high or low salt in the first phase, the second phase is the remaining level)&#xD;

    <description>Plasma volume (PV) was determined by the indicator tracer-dilution technique, using the DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer (BVA)-100 system (DAXOR Corporation), on Day 7 of the low sodium and high sodium dietary interventions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnitude of Orthostatic Tachycardia</measure>
    <time_frame>Supine and upright heart rate were measured after 6 days of each dietary sodium level</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the magnitude of the heart rate increase that occurs in patients with POTS when moving from a supine to an upright position is attenuated by a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Heart rate was assessed after overnight rest and fasting after midnight, following at least 60 minutes of lying quietly. Heart rate was then measured at intervals after subjects had been standing for up to 30 minutes (as tolerated). Differences between supine and standing values are presented for 5 minutes standing (or maximal stand if &lt;5 minutes) since several patients were unable to stand for 10 minutes.&#xD;
Data in POTS patients were compared to that of Healthy Controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upright Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Upright symptoms were assessed on the 6th day of low or high sodium diet.</time_frame>
    <description>Whether upright symptoms were improved in patients with POTS on a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Patients were asked to report their standing symptom burden at the end of the Stand portion of the posture study, using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptoms Scale (VOSS). They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum score of 10. The sum of the individual symptom scores was used to calculate orthostatic symptom burden for each participant. The lowest possible total score was 0, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 0, and the highest possible score was 90, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 10. Higher scores indicated worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Upright Symptom Score</title>
        <description>Whether upright symptoms were improved in patients with POTS on a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Patients were asked to report their standing symptom burden at the end of the Stand portion of the posture study, using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptoms Scale (VOSS). They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum score of 10. The sum of the individual symptom scores was used to calculate orthostatic symptom burden for each participant. The lowest possible total score was 0, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 0, and the highest possible score was 90, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 10. Higher scores indicated worse symptoms.</description>

          <title>Upright Symptom Score</title>
          <description>Whether upright symptoms were improved in patients with POTS on a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Patients were asked to report their standing symptom burden at the end of the Stand portion of the posture study, using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptoms Scale (VOSS). They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum score of 10. The sum of the individual symptom scores was used to calculate orthostatic symptom burden for each participant. The lowest possible total score was 0, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 0, and the highest possible score was 90, if a participant scored all 9 questions as 10. Higher scores indicated worse symptoms.</description>
