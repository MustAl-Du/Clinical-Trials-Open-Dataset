      Twenty percent of Americans suffer from chronic pain. Sleep disturbance is similarly&#xD;
      prevalent and among the most common and disabling neurobehavioral problems associated with&#xD;
      chronic pain. This research is designed to evaluate the effects of disrupted sleep patterns&#xD;
      on mood, inflammation, the perception of pain, and pain relief. This study will help&#xD;
      researchers understand the relationship between sleep and pain, and how sleep disturbance&#xD;
      might influence chronic pain conditions.&#xD;

      This research is being conducted in order to evaluate the effects of disrupted sleep patterns&#xD;
      on mood, inflammation, the perception of pain, and pain relief. This study will help&#xD;
      researchers understand the relationship between sleep and pain, and how sleep disturbance&#xD;
      might influence chronic pain conditions. Healthy participants will undergo baseline sleep and&#xD;
      sleep disruption conditions. Following undisturbed sleep and sleep disruption conditions,&#xD;
      sensitivity to pain and analgesic response (via morphine or placebo administration) will be&#xD;
      assessed using a heat-capsaicin pain model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 2 major parts-3 screening visits (2 outpatient and 1&#xD;
      inpatient) and 2 experimental inpatient visits. Part 1 of the study will involve a 1-week&#xD;
      screening period. This will involve two separate screening visits lasting about 2 hours each.&#xD;
      At Screening Visit 1, participants will complete questionnaires, an interview, and undergo&#xD;
      toxicology screening. At Screening Visit 2, participants will complete questionnaires,&#xD;
      undergo a physical exam, and be familiarized with pain testing procedures. At Screening Visit&#xD;
      3, participants will undergo an inpatient sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will involve two different inpatient admissions. The two admissions will be separated&#xD;
      by at least two weeks. During each of the admissions, participants' sleep will be studied at&#xD;
      night. The first admission will begin immediately following the overnight sleep study in&#xD;
      Screening Visit 3. One of the admissions will be for one night and the other admission will&#xD;
      be for three nights. For the one night admission, participants will sleep undisturbed for an&#xD;
      8-hour period. For the three night admission, participants will undergo sleep disruption for&#xD;
      two nights in a row. On the third night, participants will be allowed to sleep undisturbed&#xD;
      for 8 hours for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both inpatient admissions, pain testing procedures will be completed that will last&#xD;
      approximately 5 hours during the day. During testing, small amounts of blood will be drawn&#xD;
      for analysis. Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. Group A will be given a&#xD;
      standard dose of morphine during pain testing. Group B will be given a placebo during pain&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

    <measure>Spinal Sensitization as Assessed by Area of Secondary Hyperalgesia (2HA) After Two Nights of Uninterrupted Sleep and Two Nights of 8 Forced Awakenings</measure>
    <time_frame>Next day during quantitative sensory testing after 2 nights of forced awakenings or uninterrupted sleep</time_frame>
    <description>The area of secondary hyperalgesia (2HA) to mechanical stimulation was quantified by stimulating along eight linear paths near the capsaicin treated site using a 15 gram nonpainful von Frey filament. Stimulation occurred until the participant reported a change in sensation from which a border was marked on the skin. The degree of 2HA was assessed by measuring the total surface area (mm^2) of the marked borders. Data were collapsed by group to analyze the effects of FA vs US, irrespective of randomization group. Our Primary Secondary Hyperalgesia outcome was measured prior to injection of either morphine or placebo.</description>

    <measure>Opioid Analgesia as Assessed by Analgesia Index (Seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>Next day after 2 nights of forced awakenings or uninterrupted sleep</time_frame>
    <description>After 2 nights of forced awakenings and after two nights of uninterrupted sleep, opioid analgesia will be assessed by an analgesia index. The analgesia index is calculated using withdrawal latency during cold pressor testing (lasting maximum of 300 seconds). Cold Pressor Testing is done before and after morphine or placebo injection. The difference in withdrawal time before and after morphine or placebo injection is the analgesia index with a minimum score of -300 seconds and maximum score of 300 seconds. These data were log transformed. Mean analgesia index was then calculated for each group. Higher means represent greater analgesia.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Percentage of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Expressing Interleukin-6 After LPS Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Next day after 2 nights of forced awakenings or uninterrupted sleep, every 60 minutes up to 7 hours</time_frame>
    <description>After 2 nights of forced awakenings, and two nights of uninterrupted sleep, blood is drawn (approximately every 60 minutes) during quantitative sensory testing; 4 hours pre-morphine/placebo administration and 2 hours post-morphine/placebo administration to examine markers of inflammation. Two blood samples for each participant are analyzed at 7 separate time points. The marker of inflammation assessed is the number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the outcome measure represents the mean change in IL-6 levels pre and post stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cellular IL-6 expression was was quantified via flow cytometry.</description>

        <title>Spinal Sensitization as Assessed by Area of Secondary Hyperalgesia (2HA) After Two Nights of Uninterrupted Sleep and Two Nights of 8 Forced Awakenings</title>
        <description>The area of secondary hyperalgesia (2HA) to mechanical stimulation was quantified by stimulating along eight linear paths near the capsaicin treated site using a 15 gram nonpainful von Frey filament. Stimulation occurred until the participant reported a change in sensation from which a border was marked on the skin. The degree of 2HA was assessed by measuring the total surface area (mm^2) of the marked borders. Data were collapsed by group to analyze the effects of FA vs US, irrespective of randomization group. Our Primary Secondary Hyperalgesia outcome was measured prior to injection of either morphine or placebo.</description>

        <title>Opioid Analgesia as Assessed by Analgesia Index (Seconds)</title>
        <description>After 2 nights of forced awakenings and after two nights of uninterrupted sleep, opioid analgesia will be assessed by an analgesia index. The analgesia index is calculated using withdrawal latency during cold pressor testing (lasting maximum of 300 seconds). Cold Pressor Testing is done before and after morphine or placebo injection. The difference in withdrawal time before and after morphine or placebo injection is the analgesia index with a minimum score of -300 seconds and maximum score of 300 seconds. These data were log transformed. Mean analgesia index was then calculated for each group. Higher means represent greater analgesia.</description>

        <population>Each participant had to do four visits and two testing sessions to be termed complete. The data needed for analysis for this outcome measure was obtained from some participants but not all who completed or couldn't complete the entire study. This explains the differences in the number of units analyzed.</population>

        <title>Mean Change in Percentage of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Expressing Interleukin-6 After LPS Stimulation</title>
        <description>After 2 nights of forced awakenings, and two nights of uninterrupted sleep, blood is drawn (approximately every 60 minutes) during quantitative sensory testing; 4 hours pre-morphine/placebo administration and 2 hours post-morphine/placebo administration to examine markers of inflammation. Two blood samples for each participant are analyzed at 7 separate time points. The marker of inflammation assessed is the number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the outcome measure represents the mean change in IL-6 levels pre and post stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cellular IL-6 expression was was quantified via flow cytometry.</description>

        <time_frame>Next day during quantitative sensory testing after 2 nights of forced awakenings or uninterrupted sleep.</time_frame>
        <population>Each participant had to do four visits to be termed complete.
