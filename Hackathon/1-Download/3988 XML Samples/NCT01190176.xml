  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to provide up to a maximum of four years of annual oncogenic human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and cervical cytology examination for NCT00294047 study&#xD;
      subjects who displayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV&#xD;
      infection at their concluding NCT00294047 study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who were pregnant at their concluding NCT00294047 study visit may also be included in&#xD;
      this study, as no cervical sample could be collected at that visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase (NCT00294047) are presented in a&#xD;
      separate protocol posting.&#xD;
