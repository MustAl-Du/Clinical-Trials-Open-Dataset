  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral&#xD;
      health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV&#xD;
      and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by&#xD;
      providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a vulnerable&#xD;
      and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk&#xD;
      in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will&#xD;
      advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with implications&#xD;
      for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other&#xD;
      disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction&#xD;
      intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors,&#xD;
      injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged,&#xD;
      drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This aim will be accomplished through&#xD;
      the random selection of high-risk rural women drug users from rural jails, screening and&#xD;
      assessment for high-risk behavior, and random assignment to the HIV-Ed or MI-HIV intervention&#xD;
      conditions. Follow-up interviews at 3, 6, and 12 months in the community post-release will&#xD;
      examine changes in high-risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV participants will report&#xD;
      significantly greater reductions in risky injection drug use practices, other drug use, and&#xD;
      sex risk behaviors than women who participate in the HIV-Ed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and&#xD;
      behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at&#xD;
      follow-up among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This aim&#xD;
      will focus on community service utilization during the follow-up period by the intervention&#xD;
      and education comparison group, and how health and behavioral health service utilization&#xD;
      relates to patterns of HIV/HCV risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV participants will&#xD;
      utilize more services due to increased motivation for treatment and treatment planning&#xD;
      following the brief intervention.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Adult women were randomly selected from three rural jails in Appalachia, screened, and interviewed face-to-face in a private room in the jail. Study eligibility included: 1) moderate risk of substance abuse based on the NIDA-ASSIST score of 4+ for any drug; 2) residing in Appalachia before incarceration; and 3) willingness to participate.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 688 screened, 248 (36%) did not meet eligibility criteria due to: not being released during time frame (n=203), not engaging in risky sexual practices (n=15), not being from Appalachian (n=21), and not meeting NM-ASSIST criteria (n=9). 440 (64%) met criteria, but 40 were released prior to completing the baseline. The final N=400.</pre_assignment_details>
