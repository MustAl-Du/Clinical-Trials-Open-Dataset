  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new medical technology can temporarily&#xD;
      alter pain perception. The new technology is called Transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects underwent thermal pain tolerance testing pre- and post intervention. The&#xD;
      intervention includes either anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS for 20 minutes during a pain&#xD;
      cognitive intervention [either brief cognitive intervention (BCI) or general pain education].&#xD;
      The tDCS brand was the Phoresor-II Auto (Model PM850, Iomed, Salt Lake City Utah, USA) and&#xD;
      the current was set to 2.0mA. Electrodes were 4x4 cm sponge electrodes soaked in sterile&#xD;
      saline. For anodal and cathodal tDCS, One electrode was placed over the left DLPFC (F3 from&#xD;
      the EEG 10-20 system) located via the Beam F3 measurement system and the other electrode was&#xD;
      attached to the right shoulder. For sham tDCS, the device was turned on for 30 seconds to&#xD;
      temporarily mimic tingling and skin sensations of real tDCS and then ramped-down to 0mA for&#xD;
      the duration of the 20-minute session.&#xD;

          <description>Participants underwent Brief Cognitive intervention (BCI) during a single 20-minute session of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the anode electrode placed over the left DLPFC and the cathode electrode attached to the right shoulder. BCI entails listening to a 3-minute audio recording designed to mimic key components of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain.&#xD;
