      The purpose of this study is to compare the immediate and long term (up to 5 years)&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' MenACWY-TT vaccine when given as a single dose&#xD;
      or as 2 doses to toddlers aged 12 to 14 months. Also, this study will also assess if&#xD;
      co-administration of GSK Biologicals' MenACWY-TT with the booster dose of Pfizer's Prevenar&#xD;
      13 adversely impacts the immunogenicity of either of the vaccines.&#xD;

      The Medicines Control Council (MCC) authorities requested that subjects be screened for HIV&#xD;
      testing prior to study enrolment in South Africa to ensure that only HIV negative&#xD;
      participants are enrolled. As such, HIV rapid test was added at Visit 1 only for subjects in&#xD;
      South Africa. Subjects previously screened HIV positive will be excluded.&#xD;

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) With rSBA for Each of the 4 Serogroups Following Vaccination at Year 5 in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d Groups</title>
        <description>Geometric mean titers of antibodies against each serogroup were assessed using rSBA. Serogroups included neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W-135 (MenW-135) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). rSBA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for persistence Year 5 included all participants who met eligibility criteria, received complete primary vaccination series, had assay results available for at least 1 antigen tested, complied with procedures and intervals in protocol, did not present medical condition, received product or were non-compliant with protocol-defined serum sampling windows or lack of availability of immunogenicity results at the previous time point.</description>

        <description>GMCs for anti-pneumococcal antibodies (anti-1, anti-3, anti-4, anti-5, anti-6A, anti-6B, anti-7F, anti-9V, anti-14, anti-18C, anti-19A, anti-19F and anti-23F) were measured in microgram per milliliter (mcg/mL). ATP cohort for immunogenicity post dose 1 included all evaluable participants who met eligibility criteria, complied with the procedures defined in the protocol and with no elimination criteria during the study from the ATP cohort for safety, received all study vaccines at Month 0, had assay results available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component at Visit 2 (Month 1), and had available blood sample at Visit 2 (Month 1) for PCV13 group.</description>

        <description>Geometric mean titers of antibodies against each serogroup were assessed using hSBA. Serogroups included neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W-135 (MenW-135) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). hSBA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for persistence Year 1 included all participants who met eligibility criteria, received complete primary vaccination series, had assay results available for at least 1 antigen tested, complied with procedures and intervals in protocol, did not present medical condition, received product or were non-compliant with protocol-defined serum sampling windows or lack of availability of immunogenicity results at the previous time point.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) With rSBA for Each of the 4 Serogroups Following Vaccination at 1 Month After Administration of 1 Dose of MenACWY-TT in ACWY1d, ACWY2d and Co-ad Groups</title>
        <description>Geometric mean titers of antibodies against each serogroup were assessed using rSBA. Serogroups included neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W-135 (MenW-135) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). rSBA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for persistence Year 1 included all participants who met eligibility criteria, received complete primary vaccination series, had assay results available for at least 1 antigen tested, complied with procedures and intervals in protocol, did not present medical condition, received product or were non-compliant with protocol-defined serum sampling windows or lack of availability of immunogenicity results at the previous time point.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) With hSBA for Each of the 4 Serogroups Following Vaccination at Year 1, 3 and 5 in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d Groups</title>
        <description>Geometric mean titers of antibodies against each serogroup were assessed using hSBA. Serogroups included neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W-135 (MenW-135) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). hSBA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for persistence Year 1, 3 and 5 included all participants who met eligibility criteria, received complete primary vaccination series, had assay results available for at least 1 antigen tested, complied with procedures and intervals in protocol, did not present medical condition, received product or were non-compliant with protocol-defined serum sampling windows or lack of availability of immunogenicity results at the previous time point.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) With rSBA for Each of the 4 Serogroups Following Vaccination at Year 1, 3 and 5 in the Co-ad and PCV-13 Groups</title>
        <description>Geometric mean titers of antibodies against each serogroup were assessed using rSBA. Serogroups included neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC), Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W-135 (MenW-135) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). rSBA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for persistence Year 1, 3 and 5 included all participants who met eligibility criteria, received complete primary vaccination series, had assay results available for at least 1 antigen tested, complied with procedures and intervals in protocol, did not present medical condition, received product or were non-compliant with protocol-defined serum sampling windows or lack of availability of immunogenicity results at the previous time point.</description>

        <description>OPA titers were determined for anti-pneumococcal serotypes: OPSONO-1, OPSONO-3, OPSONO-4, OPSONO-5, OPSONO-6A, OPSONO-6B, OPSONO-7F, OPSONO-9V, OPSONO-14, OPSONO-18C, OPSONO-19A, OPSONO-19F and OPSONO-23F. Percentage of participants with OPA titers &gt;=1:8 against each serogroup at 1 month after administration of Prevnar 13 are reported. ATP cohort for immunogenicity post dose 1 included all evaluable participants who met eligibility criteria, complied with the procedures defined in the protocol and with no elimination criteria during the study from the ATP cohort for safety, received all study vaccines at Month 0, had assay results available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component at Visit 2, those with available blood sample at Visit 2 for PCV13 group.</description>

        <description>OPA titers were determined for anti-pneumococcal serotypes: OPSONO-1, OPSONO-3, OPSONO-4, OPSONO-5, OPSONO-6A, OPSONO-6B, OPSONO-7F, OPSONO-9V, OPSONO-14, OPSONO-18C, OPSONO-19A, OPSONO-19F and OPSONO-23F. OPA titers are expressed as 1/dilution. ATP cohort for immunogenicity post dose 1 included all evaluable participants who met eligibility criteria, complied with the procedures defined in the protocol and with no elimination criteria during the study from the ATP cohort for safety, received all study vaccines at Month 0, had assay results available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component at Visit 2, those with available blood sample at Visit 2 for PCV13 group.</description>
