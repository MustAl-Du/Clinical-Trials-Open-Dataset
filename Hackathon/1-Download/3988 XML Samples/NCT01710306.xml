      Women and Reserve/National (RNG) Veterans are among the fastest growing groups of new VA&#xD;
      users. While PTSD is prevalent in this group, most women don't access or complete needed&#xD;
      treatment. This study will investigate Operation enduring/Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn&#xD;
      (OEF/OIF/OND) RNG female war Veterans' perceptions, preferences, barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      accessing VA mental health (MH) and evidence-based PTSD psychotherapy. This information will&#xD;
      be used to revise an existing web-based screen that educates participants about their unique&#xD;
      post-deployment MH conditions. This web-interface will then be used to randomly assign women&#xD;
      who screen positive for PTSD to either 1) a concierge nurse case manager who uses shared&#xD;
      decision-making to engage Veterans in EBP or 2) usual outreach to determine what engagement&#xD;
      approach women prefer. The investigators' findings will provide VA leaders with key&#xD;
      information to understand and improve access to RNG PTSD treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Women and OEF/OIF/OND Reserve/National Guard (RNG) war Veterans are among the fastest growing&#xD;
      groups of new VA users. Although PTSD is highly prevalent in this group of Veterans, most&#xD;
      choose not to seek care for a variety of reasons. Facilitating access to mental health (MH)&#xD;
      services for RNG OEF/OIF/OND female Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is&#xD;
      challenging and requires new approaches to outreach. Such approaches are urgently needed to&#xD;
      mediate the severity of post-deployment MH conditions, alleviate concerns over MH diagnoses,&#xD;
      and interrupt the cycle of chronicity found in many with PTSD. This gap between need for and&#xD;
      use of VA PTSD services suggests that further research is needed to understand specific&#xD;
      barriers to VA mental health (MH) care and VA PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP). A&#xD;
      web-based interface tailored to consumer needs has the potential to promote active engagement&#xD;
      by Veterans in their health care. Considering that OEF/OIF combat Veterans enrolled in VA&#xD;
      care report a preference to seek readjustment services or information over the internet, such&#xD;
      an approach may have important advantages for engaging this group. Furthermore, evidence&#xD;
      indicates that when patients are educated about their physical health conditions and&#xD;
      treatment alternatives, shared decision-making results in increased treatment participation,&#xD;
      better adherence to treatment recommendations, and better health outcomes. Although highly&#xD;
      promising, web-based and shared-decision making approaches to facilitating VA MH treatment&#xD;
      utilization are in need of further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 of the project, the investigators will use qualitative methods to assess VA&#xD;
      enrolled PTSD positive OEF/OIF/OND RNG female war Veterans' perceptions, preferences and&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to accessing VA MH services and evidence based psychotherapy (EBP)&#xD;
      for PTSD. This information will be used to refine the investigators' existing web-based&#xD;
      interface to better address these issues. Satisfaction with the revised interface will then&#xD;
      be assessed. Phase 2 will focus on comparing the efficacy of two approaches to promoting VHA&#xD;
      initiation. Participants who screen positive for PTSD on the web interface will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to: 1) Study concierge nurse case manager (NCM) facilitated shared decision making&#xD;
      to assist with VA MH evaluation and treatment; or 2) existing outreach (current standard of&#xD;
      care). Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 6 and 12 months to determine whether and&#xD;
      where participants sought MH care (from both VA and non-VA resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide valuable insights about this population's perceptions of VA MH&#xD;
      services and of PTSD EBP, as well as their evolving use of VA and other community resources&#xD;
      to address PTSD and other post-deployment MH needs. Furthermore, it will provide important&#xD;
      information regarding the efficacy of relatively inexpensive and resource-sparing&#xD;
      interventions that can be readily implemented within existing and emerging (e.g., Patient&#xD;
      Alight Care Teams [PACT]) models of VA care delivery. While the proposed web interface and&#xD;
      shared decision-making intervention are currently directed at RNG women Veterans&#xD;
      post-deployment, there are clear implications for expansion to other populations and&#xD;
      health/MH concerns, as well. Findings have important policy implications for several&#xD;
      operational partners heavily invested in the improved access and delivery of evidence-based&#xD;
      mental health care for Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) administered on line to RCT participants yields a patient activation score allowing comparison of patient activation with other populations/studies The PAM-13 item measures patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for medical self-management. It is scored on a scale from 0-100. These scores result in four levels of patient activation that range from 1 to 4 with 1 being the lowest level of patient activation for taking action and 4 the highest level of activation. Specifically: 1=believing the patient role is important. 2=having confidence/knowledge necessary to take action. 3=actually taking action to maintain/improve one's health. 4=maintaining health actions, even under stress. The percentage of participants in each arm who had a PAM score that indicated a level of activation/taking action (levels 3 and 4) will be identified.</description>

        <title>Patient Activation Measure</title>
        <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) administered on line to RCT participants yields a patient activation score allowing comparison of patient activation with other populations/studies The PAM-13 item measures patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for medical self-management. It is scored on a scale from 0-100. These scores result in four levels of patient activation that range from 1 to 4 with 1 being the lowest level of patient activation for taking action and 4 the highest level of activation. Specifically: 1=believing the patient role is important. 2=having confidence/knowledge necessary to take action. 3=actually taking action to maintain/improve one's health. 4=maintaining health actions, even under stress. The percentage of participants in each arm who had a PAM score that indicated a level of activation/taking action (levels 3 and 4) will be identified.</description>
