  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a quality indicator of colonoscopy performed for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening. Population studies have shown that traditional air colonoscopy fails to&#xD;
      eliminate post screening colonoscopy cancers or cancer mortality in the proximal colon. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to establish the superior effectiveness of combining chromoendoscopy with&#xD;
      the water exchange method in detecting more proximal diminutive adenomas during screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy in sedated Veterans. An improved adenoma detection rate associated with optical&#xD;
      colonoscopy will minimize the risk of missed lesions. The improvement may translate into a&#xD;
      remedy for the limitations of screening colonoscopy in the proximal colon, e.g. a higher&#xD;
      adenoma detection rate may minimize the burden of post screening colonoscopy interval&#xD;
      colorectal cancers among the veteran population.&#xD;

      1. Design: Prospective, single center, patient blinded, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods: Colonoscopy with traditional air insufflation, water exchange or water exchange&#xD;
           plus indigocarmine to aid insertion of colonoscope; split dose bowel preparation; all&#xD;
           patients will receive sedation; assessment of serum electrolytes level before and after&#xD;
           colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Control method: Traditional air insufflation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Water exchange method.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Unit(s) of analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary outcome: overall adenoma detection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary outcomes: patient demographic variable and procedure related measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sampling strategy: all Veterans referred for screening colonoscopy will be offered&#xD;
           enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sample size calculation. A total of 480 subjects will be recruited and randomized&#xD;
                with 160 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Subject recruitment: patients referred for screening colonoscopy come from three sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Description of base population and groups to be studied and method of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans between age 50 and 75 referred for first time screening colonoscopy. After informed&#xD;
