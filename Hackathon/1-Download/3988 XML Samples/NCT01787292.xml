  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test whether differing levels of physical fitness&#xD;
      affects patterns of motor dexterity and brain activity that have been shown to differ due to&#xD;
      aging. Testing will take place at the Atlanta VA Medical Center and at Emory University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be healthy adults within the target age range of 60-85 for the study. The&#xD;
      study will require multiple visits over 15 months. There will be about 64 people volunteering&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Census reports over 14 million U.S. Veterans (&gt;63%) are beyond mid-life (&gt;55 years).&#xD;
      Declines in upper extremity motor performance respective of strength and dexterity are well&#xD;
      documented within this age cohort). Recent cross-sectional research has discovered that aging&#xD;
      related motor deficits may be influenced by a loss of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI)&#xD;
      between primary motor cortices. However, this loss may not be an inevitable consequence of&#xD;
      aging. Work from previous VA OAA Predoctoral and CDA-1 awards have shown that aerobic fitness&#xD;
      may serve to mitigate losses in interhemispheric inhibition assessed by both functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). That is,&#xD;
      individuals who are aerobically fit show higher levels of IHI and improved dexterity and&#xD;
      reaction times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of new evidence from the investigators' lab's recent cross-sectional studies,&#xD;
      physical activity over the long term (at least 2-5 years) may serve to alter levels of IHI&#xD;
      and improve motor performance in the upper extremity. Aerobic exercise may provide a&#xD;
      mechanism (reduced loss of interhemispheric inhibition) that could serve to improve motor&#xD;
      function, but the neural mechanism responsible for such effects remains unclear. Previous&#xD;
      investigations of interhemispheric communication and exercise have been limited by nature of&#xD;
      inquiry, as cross-sectional research cannot measure changes over time in participants. As&#xD;
      such, it is currently unknown how exercise may directly affect levels of interhemispheric&#xD;
      communication and motor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions (motor strength and coordination) have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      improving upper extremity motor performance in older adults, however the duration of these&#xD;
      gains appear to be short-lived. After as little as a few weeks of detraining, motor strength&#xD;
      and coordination in the upper extremity rapidly begins to return to pre-intervention levels.&#xD;
      Evidence from exercise interventions assessing gait and locomotion have shown that exercise&#xD;
      programs over a longer term (&gt;6 months) are associated with improved proprioception, fewer&#xD;
      falls and better balance. However, the comparison of outcomes of upper extremity function in&#xD;
      elderly adults respective of exercise duration remains largely unexplored. In addition to&#xD;
      comparing the effects of short-term exercise (3 months) versus behavioral training (3 months)&#xD;
      on upper extremity function, the current proposal will evaluate if a longer-term (6 months)&#xD;
      exercise program can maintain or enhance upper extremity function and associated levels of&#xD;
      interhemispheric inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study proposes the next logical step in my line of research and directly&#xD;
      investigates the effects of exercise in an intervention with sedentary older Veterans (50-80&#xD;
      years), a group most likely to exhibit aging-related motor deficits. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to enroll 40 Veterans into an upper extremity dexterity improvement program involving&#xD;
      behavioral and exercise components. The behavioral intervention is a muscle coordination&#xD;
      training previously shown to improve unimanual motor performance in older adults. The&#xD;
      exercise intervention is a supervised group cycling regimen. The figure below shows the study&#xD;
      design. Interhemispheric communication will be assessed with fMRI, and TMS.&#xD;

The area under the curve is an estimate of the fMRI hemodynamic response impulse response function. A higher number of AUC indicates less interhemispheric inhibition. In contrast, a lower number in this analysis indicates higher interhemispheric inhibition.</description>

Group one received a 12-week Aerobic exercise intervention and then crossed over into a balance exercise intervention. Group two received the balance intervention for 12 weeks and then crossed over into the aerobic exercise intervention. All completing participants then engaged in a home based exercise program during which they were instructed to exercise thrice weekly over 24 weeks.</description>

      <time_frame>60 month. Participants were assessed at baseline, after 12-weeks, after 24 weeks and after 48 weeks. Measurements at 12 weeks represent first intervention. Measurements at 24 weeks represent measure after cross-over into alternate intervention. All participants then went through a home-based exercise program, which is the 48 week assessment. Note: Participants may have withdrawn from the study prior to completing the home-based exercise program.</time_frame>

          <description>Participants completed a 12-week interval aerobic cycling under supervised trainers three times per week for 20-45 minutes per session. After two to four week washout period, participants entered a second 12-week intervention involving light stretching and balance exercise under a supervised trainer three times per week for 20-45 minutes per session.&#xD;
Participants later crossed over into the Balance condition and were assessed at 24 weeks.&#xD;
After this time, participants completed a 24 week home based aerobic exercise program. This intervention was common to both groups and therefore are collapsed within this Arm.</description>
