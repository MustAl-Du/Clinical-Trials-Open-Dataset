    <textblock>
      In this research study, we are using heart imaging exams and blood testing, in order to gain&#xD;
      an improved understanding of the pulmonary (lung) hypertension and cardiovascular (heart)&#xD;
      complications that often occur in sickle cell patients. Information gathered from the healthy&#xD;
      volunteers that participate in this study will be compared to information from the sickle&#xD;
      cell patients in this study in order to help further our understanding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has gained increasing clinical application in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary diseases. Due to its 3-dimensional nature, CMR is considered the&#xD;
      gold-standard for quantifying left and right ventricular systolic function and size.&#xD;
      Additionally, its high tissue contrast allows for a detailed characterization of myocardial&#xD;
      tissue. Specifically, the use of techniques such as late gadolinium enhancement can be used&#xD;
      to detect the presence of tiny amounts of myocardial scar. Other techniques have been shown&#xD;
      to correlate strongly with myocardial iron content. Just as importantly, CMR perfusion&#xD;
      imaging can accurately quantify myocardial blood flow and can provide tremendous insight into&#xD;
      the function of the microcirculation. CMR's high spatial and temporal resolution, its&#xD;
      3-dimensional approach, its ability to characterize the tissue, and its ability to evaluate&#xD;
      the micro- and macro-circulation make it a comprehensive technique for the evaluation of&#xD;
      heart disease. Recently, one CMR study has already shown the presence of cardiac&#xD;
      microvascular disease in a subset of adult sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in the absence&#xD;
      of infarcted myocardium, myocardial iron overload, or coronary artery disease, increasing the&#xD;
      evidence for the contribution of left heart disease to pulmonary hypertension (PH)&#xD;
      development in these patients; unfortunately, strong conclusions could not be made because&#xD;
      the study was underpowered. Thus, this proposal will leverage the advantages offered by CMR&#xD;
      to better characterize and detect the PH and cardiopulmonary subphenotypes in the SCD patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to small sample size, caution should be considered in applying these results to all patients with SCD, in particular to those with genotypes outside of hemoglobin and those with a recent or ongoing crisis. Not all patients had evaluable data sets for all of the cardiovascular tests, due to inadequate venous access, frequently encountered in patients with SCD. Finally, our follow-up period is currently too short to make meaningful comments on outcomes such as mortality and functional status.</limitations_and_caveats>
