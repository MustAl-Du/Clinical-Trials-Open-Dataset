      This extension study is designed to assess the safety of GSK Biological's human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine GSK580299 in female subjects who took part in the primary study&#xD;
      NCT00294047 and received the control vaccine in countries for which the licensed GSK HPV&#xD;
      vaccine is not indicated for the subject's age group (26 years and older). This study is thus&#xD;
      conducted to enable all women who received the control placebo in the primary NCT00294047&#xD;
      study to receive the GSK580299 vaccine.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from Day 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed SAEs included medical occurrences that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or were congenital anomalies/birth defects in the offspring of a study subject. Any SAE = occurrence of the SAE regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 SAE = an SAE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related SAE = an SAE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Medically Significant Conditions (MSCs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from Day 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Medically significant conditions were defined as: AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that were not (1) related to common diseases, or (2) not related to routine visits for physical examination or vaccination, or as SAEs that were not related to common diseases. Common diseases included: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle abnormalities and injury. Any MSC = occurrence of the MSC regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 MSC = a MSC which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related MSC = MSC assessed by the investigator as related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Potentially Immune-Mediated Diseases (pIMDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from Day 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>pIMD(s) are a subset of medically significant conditions (MSCs) that included autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest which may or may not have had an autoimmune aetiology. Any pIMD = occurrence of the pIMD regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pIMD = a pIMD which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related pIMD = pIMD assessed by the investigator as related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Pregnancies and Outcomes of the Reported Pregnancies</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from Day 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy is the term used to describe the period in which a fetus develops inside a woman's womb or uterus. In this study, the number of subjects with pregnancies was calculated. The subjects with confirmed pregnancies were followed up to determine the outcomes of the reported pregnancies.</description>

          <description>pIMD(s) are a subset of medically significant conditions (MSCs) that included autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest which may or may not have had an autoimmune aetiology. Any pIMD = occurrence of the pIMD regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pIMD = a pIMD which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related pIMD = pIMD assessed by the investigator as related to the study vaccination.</description>
