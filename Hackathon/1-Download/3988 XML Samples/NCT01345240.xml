        <description>Concentrations, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The assay cut-off was the seropositivity cut-off value of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10 mIU/mL. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HBs ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Results presented are for the study groups receiving the RTS,S vaccine, pooled by vaccine lot, that is, for the RTS,S Lot 1, RTS,S Lot 2, and RTS,S Lot 3 groups, as defined below.</description>

        <title>Anti-Hepatitis B (HBs) Antibody Concentrations at Month 38, 50 and 51</title>
        <description>Concentrations, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The assay cut-off was the seropositivity cut-off value of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10 mIU/mL. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HBs ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Results presented are for each RTS,S Regimen A, B &amp; C, and for each Engerix B Regimen A &amp; B study groups.</description>
        <time_frame>At Months 38, 50 and 51, aka 36 and 48 months post Dose 3 of RTS,S vaccine or Engerix-B and one month post the Month 50 booster dose of Engerix-B</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

        <title>Pneumococcal Antibody Concentrations Against Synflorix Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes at Month 17</title>
        <description>Antibody concentrations were measured by GSK assay, and expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were the serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. The cut-off of the assay, by GSK assay, was greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.2 μg/mL. This corresponds to the standard ELISA value of 0.35 μg/mL. This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix -B vaccine co-administered with Synflorix. Results presented are for the study groups pooled by co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen A and Engerix -B Regimen A groups.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 17, aka one month post the Month 16 booster dose of Synflorix</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix-Hib, Polio Sabin and Synflorix, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix-Hib and Synflorix, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix and Polio Sabin orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>

        <title>Titers for Opsonophagocytic Activity Against Synflorix Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes at Month 3</title>
        <description>The pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were the serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50 % killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The cut-off of the assay was an opsonic dilution &gt;= 8. This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix-B vaccine co-administered with Synflorix. Results presented are for the study groups pooled by co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen A and Engerix-B Regimen A groups.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 3, aka at one month (1M) post Dose 3 of Synflorix</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

            <description>This group results from the pooling of the RTS,S Regimen A Lot 1, RTS,S Regimen A Lot 2 and RTS,S Regimen A Lot 3 groups. Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix-Hib, Polio Sabin and Synflorix, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix-Hib and Synflorix, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix and Polio Sabin orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>

        <title>Titers for Opsonophagocytic Activity Against Synflorix Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes at Month 17</title>
        <description>The pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were the serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50 % killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The cut-off of the assay was an opsonic dilution &gt;= 8. This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix -B vaccine co-administered with Synflorix . Results presented are for the study groups pooled by co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen A and Engerix -B Regimen A groups.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 17, aka one month post the Month 16 booster dose of Synflorix</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity measures were available.</population>

            <description>This group results from the pooling of the RTS,S Regimen A Lot 1, RTS,S Regimen A Lot 2 and RTS,S Regimen A Lot 3 groups. Subjects, healthy male and female infants aged between 8 and 12 weeks inclusive at the time of first vaccination, received 3 doses of RTS,S vaccine, Lot 1, 2 or 3, co-administered with Infanrix-Hib, Polio Sabin and Synflorix, at Weeks 0, 4 and 8, and 2 doses of Rotarix vaccine, at Weeks 6 and 10. In addition, subjects also received one dose of vaccine against yellow fever and against measles, at Week 32, and one booster dose of Infanrix-Hib and Synflorix, at Month 16, and one booster dose of Engerix B vaccine, at Month 50. The RTS,S vaccine and Engerix B were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the left anterolateral thigh, Infanrix-Hib IM in the right deltoid, Synflorix IM in the right anterolateral thigh, and Rotarix and Polio Sabin orally. The measles and yellow fever vaccines were administered IM in the deltoid.</description>

        <title>Anti-protein D (PD) Antibody Concentrations at Month 3</title>
        <description>Anti-PD antibody concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in ELISA units per milliliter (EL.U/mL). The cut-off of the assay was the seropositivity cut-off value of greater than or equal to 100 EL.U/mL. This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix-B vaccine co-administered with Synflorix. Results presented are for the study groups pooled by co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen A and Engerix-B Regimen A groups.</description>

        <description>Anti-Rotavirus (anti-RV) antibody concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). The cut-off of the assay was the seropositive cut-off value of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 units per milliliter (U/mL). This outcome measure was assessed in subjects who were administered Rotarix as part of an EPI regimen, with and without RTS,S vaccine co-administration. This outcome concerns the subjects who received the RTS,S or Engerix-B vaccine co-administered with Rotarix. Results presented are for the study groups pooled by RTS,S or Engerix-B vaccine co-administration, that is, for the RTS,S Regimen B and Engerix-B Regimen B groups.</description>

        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were fever, irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite. Fever was defined as axillary temperature higher than (&gt;) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C). Analysis for this outcome was performed solely for the 7-days follow-up periods following the primary vaccination with RTS,S vaccine or Engerix-B (at Day 0, and Months 1 and 2). Data presented are those for any occurrence of the assessed solicited general symptoms, that is, the occurrences of these symptoms regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to vaccination.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects With Any, Fatal and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) From Day 0 up to Study End (Month 51)</title>
          <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or a reported adverse event of specific interest such as seizures occurring within a 30-day period of vaccination, immune-mediated disorders, and specific autoimmune diseases. A fatal SAE was defined as a SAE resulting in the death of the study subject. A related SAE was defined as a SAE assessed by the investigator as being causally related to vaccination.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available.</population>
