  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3,500 people will participate per year. The study population will include&#xD;
      females and males over 5 years of age who live in filariasis endemic areas. The study will be&#xD;
      performed in Indonesia in B. timori and W. bancrofti endemic areas over a period of 4 years.&#xD;
      Participants will be studied only once in cross-sectional surveys. Some subjects may be&#xD;
      included in more than one annual population survey, but this is not a longitudinal study.&#xD;
      Purpose of the study is to evaluate different mass drug administration (MDA) regimens for&#xD;
      lymphatic filariasis and also to study the impact of MDA on soil transmitted helminth&#xD;
      infections (STH). MDA will administered by others (e.g., Ministry of Health). Results of this&#xD;
      study may enhance efforts to control and eliminate these important neglected tropical&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that accelerated mass drug administration will be&#xD;
      superior to annual MDA for elimination of lymphatic filariasis and for control of soil&#xD;
      transmitted helminth infections (STH):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the relative impact and cost effectiveness of annual vs. twice yearly mass drug&#xD;
           administration (MDA) for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the impact of annual vs. semiannual MDA on soil transmitted helminth (STH)&#xD;
           infection in these populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a deforming and disabling infectious disease that causes&#xD;
      elephantiasis and genital deformity (especially hydroceles). The infection affects some 120&#xD;
      million people in 81 countries in tropical and subtropical regions with well over 1 billion&#xD;
      people at risk of acquiring the disease. LF is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia spp.&#xD;
      (B. malayi and B.timori), nematode parasites that are transmitted by mosquitoes. This study&#xD;
      is based on the assumption that currently used mass drug administration (MDA) regimens and&#xD;
      schedules are not optimal for achieving elimination of LF. These regimens (either annual&#xD;
      Albendazole (Alb) 400 mg plus diethylcarbamazine (DEC) 6 mg/kg or Alb 400 mg plus ivermectin&#xD;
      (Iver) 200 Âµg/kg for LF) were developed more than 10 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs used for LF MDA are also active against soil transmitted helminth infections (STH,&#xD;
      e.g., Ascaris, Hookworm, and Trichuris). De-worming campaigns using anthelminthics usually&#xD;
      target special groups of the population, such as schoolchildren, and have limited impact on&#xD;
      the transmission. Treatment of the total population and semiannual treatments may reduce&#xD;
      re-infection considerably and will most likely lead to reduced infection densities and&#xD;
      infection prevalences. Suppression of STH is an important ancillary benefit of MDA programs&#xD;
      for filarial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The study aims to compare the effectiveness once yearly (1X) versus twice yearly&#xD;
      (2X) mass drug administration (MDA) for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis and for&#xD;
      control of soil-transmitted helminths (intestinal parasites) in large populations. Mass drug&#xD;
      administration will be provided by the Indonesia Ministry of Health. This project will assess&#xD;
      the impact of the public health program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Study procedures include collection of finger prick blood that will be tested for&#xD;
      microfilaremia and for serology testing (antigenemia and antibody testing). Stool samples&#xD;
      will be collected to detect STH infections. All assays will be performed in Indonesia&#xD;
      (filarial serology tests, blood smears for detection of microfilariae (MF), and stool&#xD;
      examinations for detection of worm eggs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washington University researchers developed the protocol, will provide training and guidance&#xD;
      to Indonesian researchers, and work with them to analyze the data. Indonesian researchers&#xD;
      will consent the participants, obtain stool and blood specimens, perform laboratory tests on&#xD;
      the specimens, and enter data on participants and lab results.&#xD;
