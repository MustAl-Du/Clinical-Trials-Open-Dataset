  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is randomized controlled trial in which urgency incontinent women (approximately&#xD;
      150-160) will be randomized to hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy and evaluated at months 2, 6&#xD;
      &amp;12 Hypotheses: Among patients with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), hypnotherapy will be&#xD;
      non-inferior pharmacotherapy in diminishing UUI episodes. Hypnotherapy may be superior or may&#xD;
      not differ from pharmacotherapy in diminishing symptoms or quality of life based on validated&#xD;
      questionnaires and/or other diary parameters.&#xD;

      Study Objectives Primary: To compare change in Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) episodes at&#xD;
      2 month follow-up on voiding diaries between hypnotherapy and pharmacotherapy groups (to&#xD;
      determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective and durable in treating UUI as&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective in treating UUI as&#xD;
           pharmacotherapy comparing change in UUI episodes on voiding diary at 6 and 12 month&#xD;
           follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether hypnotherapy differs from pharmacotherapy in treating UUI comparing&#xD;
           change in questionnaire results and urinary frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enrolled following administration of the Overactive Bladder (OAB) Awareness tool.&#xD;
           Participants will keep voiding diaries then be randomized to either pharmacotherapy and&#xD;
           conventional behavioral therapy or hypnotherapy and conventional behavioral therapy.&#xD;
           Approximately 150-160 women will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur using a computer-generated randomization scheme in varying permuted&#xD;
      block sizes. Study personnel performing data entry will be masked to participants' treatment.&#xD;
      Masking participants to treatment is not feasible. Participants will be followed at 2,6 &amp; 12&#xD;
      months. Measurements will be performed before treatment, following completion of treatment&#xD;
      visits (approximately 8 weeks), and at 6 and 12 months. Primary analysis will be intention to&#xD;
      treat. Exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits: UUI participant screening: Study information given. Screening questionnaire&#xD;
      given. Visit 1 Enrollment: Formal screening for eligibility, voiding diary reviewed, if&#xD;
      eligible, written consent obtained with administration of study questionnaires, demographic&#xD;
      and past medical history administration forms, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP-Q)&#xD;
      exam &amp; hypnotic susceptibility testing scheduled. Pariticipants undergo hypnotic&#xD;
      susceptibility testing prior to randomization. Participants randomized to treatment and&#xD;
      contacted, treatments arranged. Hypnotherapy group: undergo weekly treatments over 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy group: weekly counseling sessions over 8 week: Following hypnotherapy or&#xD;
      medication counseling completion, f/u voiding diaries collected &amp; study questionnaires&#xD;
      administered. One of two long acting anti-cholinergic medications offered (Long acting&#xD;
      Tolterodine or Extended Release Oxybutynin or equivalent generic substitutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 &amp; 12 month follow-up: Pharmacotherapy subjects receive medications for 1 year and&#xD;
      Hypnotherapy subjects encouraged to continue self-hypnosis for 1 year with assistance of&#xD;
      audio-recordings, with 1 optional hypnotherapy session between 6-12 months..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants informed pharmacotherapy &amp; hypnotherapy sessions are audio-recorded and reviewed&#xD;
      ensuring manual of procedures are followed.&#xD;
