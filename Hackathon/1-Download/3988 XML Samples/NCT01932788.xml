      The purpose of this study is to give all mothers the best chance for a healthy pregnancy&#xD;
      through vitamin D supplementation. We will study women of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds&#xD;
      who will receive either the current vitamin D standard of 400 IU/day (in the prenatal&#xD;
      vitamin) or 4000 IU/day (dose found in previous pregnancy studies to achieve vitamin D&#xD;
      sufficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is sponsored by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Medical University of South&#xD;
      Carolina. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and infection-fighting&#xD;
      properties of the body in relationship to vitamin D levels. This study is being done at the&#xD;
      Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) clinics, and will involve approximately 450&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

      This project, comprised of discrete studies, expert evaluation and translation for public&#xD;
      health campaign, promotes racial health equity for pregnant women. A strong racial disparity&#xD;
      in the US surrounds vitamin D status: African American women have 20-fold and Hispanic women&#xD;
      2.4-fold greater risk of deficiency than Caucasian women. In South Carolina, greater than 70%&#xD;
      of African American, 33% of Hispanic and 12% of Caucasian pregnant women meet the Institute&#xD;
      of Medicine's (IOM's) 2010 definition of vitamin D deficiency (1-3). Such disparity on the&#xD;
      basis of race/ethnicity represents a serious public health issue. Yet, some-including the&#xD;
      IOM-argue that vitamin D deficiency minimally affects maternal and fetal health and that no&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation study has shown improved pregnancy outcome (3, 4). Results of our&#xD;
      two recently completed vitamin D trials involving 510 pregnant women throughout pregnancy&#xD;
      suggest otherwise (5-7). In the NICHD trial, women supplemented with 400 IU vitamin D/day&#xD;
      (the amount in most prenatal vitamins) vs. 2000 or 4000 IU/day not only had worse vitamin D&#xD;
      status throughout pregnancy, but combined higher risk of comorbidities of pregnancy&#xD;
      (gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, infection, preterm labor/birth and periodontal&#xD;
      inflammation) (7). In trial 2, women at two South Carolina community health centers were&#xD;
      supplemented with vitamin D and again, higher vitamin D status was associated with lower&#xD;
      comorbidities of pregnancy risk (6, 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel finding from the NICHD trial was that serum levels of active, hormonal vitamin D&#xD;
      (1,25(OH)2D) during pregnancy were optimized at twice the level normally observed in&#xD;
      non-pregnant women, levels that would be considered toxic in nonpregnant individuals. At no&#xD;
      other time in life does this relationship exist. Is the hormone at such levels driving some&#xD;
      vital process during pregnancy? If so, what is that process? There are hints as to why&#xD;
      1,25(OH)2D is elevated in pregnant women. During pregnancy, the maternal immune system&#xD;
      undergoes drastic changes for fetal protection. For example, if a solid organ composed of 50%&#xD;
      mismatched cell markers (antigens) was transplanted into a new host, it would be rejected&#xD;
      within hours; however, a fetus that is 50% mismatched with paternal antigens is protected&#xD;
      from immune destruction through a process known as immune privilege. During pregnancy the&#xD;
      body increases immune suppressive cells, reduces highly activated natural killer and&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-cells with capacity to destroy the fetus and still has the capacity to fight off&#xD;
      foreign pathogens. While the mechanisms that orchestrate this complex balance are unknown, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that due to vitamin D's ability to regulate immune cells, vitamin D is&#xD;
      responsible for many immune alterations associated with fetal immune privilege. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that correction of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy will protect against&#xD;
      immune-mediated disorders such as recurrent miscarriage, preterm birth, bacterial infections,&#xD;
      periodontal inflammation and gestational diabetes. This premise, tested and confirmed by this&#xD;
      project, will lead to public policy changes and equality in vitamin D status during&#xD;
      pregnancy. To test the validity of these hypotheses, the goals of this project are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central goal of this project is to realize racial equity for all pregnant women and their&#xD;
      developing babies in the US. To achieve this goal, there are 3 specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine how vitamin D deficiency leads to immune imbalance and subsequent disparities&#xD;
           in pregnancy health outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine how vitamin D supplementation prevents such imbalance and disparities; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Translate such findings into public health policy. By comparing women of diverse&#xD;
           racial/ethnic backgrounds who receive the current vitamin D IOM standard of 400 IU/day&#xD;
           compared to 4000 IU/day [daily dose shown to achieve optimal production of active&#xD;
           vitamin D hormone (1,25(OH)2D)], the clear effects of vitamin D will be realized.&#xD;
           Furthermore, these effects of sufficient vitamin D during pregnancy transcend the racial&#xD;
           differences of the women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 450 pregnant women&#xD;
      who will be enrolled between 10-14 weeks of gestation and followed until delivery. Following&#xD;
      written, informed consent, each mother will be randomized to receive either placebo or 4000&#xD;
      IU/day vitamin D3 plus the standard prenatal vitamin (containing 400 IU vitamin D3). She will&#xD;
      be followed monthly for a total of nine study visits. These visits will include the initial&#xD;
      recruitment of mother at 10-14 weeks of pregnancy, monthly study visits, delivery study&#xD;
      visit, and 18-month post-partum follow-up visit for mother and child. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable is maternal and neonatal health status as a function of maternal and infant vitamin&#xD;
      D status. Secondary outcome variables to be analyzed, as a function of maternal vitamin D&#xD;
      status during pregnancy will include: T-lymphocyte profile, immune function indicators,&#xD;
      neonatal growth, inflammatory cytokine profile, methylation patterns of DNA of both mother&#xD;
      and her neonate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject Selection Criteria and Recruitment: Any mother (18-45 years of age) who presents&#xD;
           to her obstetrician or midwife at the Medical University of SC (MUSC), Charleston, SC;&#xD;
           Our Lady of Mercy, Johns Island, SC; or Franklin C. Fetter, Charleston, SC obstetrical&#xD;
           facilities within the first 14 weeks after her last menstrual period (LMP) with&#xD;
           confirmation of a singleton pregnancy will be eligible for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
           Mothers of diverse ethnic backgrounds (African-American, Asian, Caucasian and Hispanic)&#xD;
           will be actively recruited. A database will be generated weekly of undelivered patients&#xD;
           for the labor and delivery staff continue to alert the staff of impending admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion Criteria: Mothers with pre-existing calcium, uncontrolled thyroid disease,&#xD;
           parathyroid conditions, or who require chronic diuretic or cardiac medication therapy&#xD;
           including calcium channel blockers will not be eligible for enrollment into the study.&#xD;
           Mothers with pre-existing sickle cell disease (not trait only), sarcoidosis, Crohn's&#xD;
           disease, or ulcerative colitis may not participate in the study. In addition, because of&#xD;
           the potentially confounding effect of multiple fetuses, mothers with multiple gestations&#xD;
           will not be eligible for participation in the study. A sub-group of approximately 100&#xD;
           subjects with known diabetes, hypertension, HIV, or morbid obesity (body mass index &gt;&#xD;
           49) will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subject Enrollment: The potential study subject's primary care provider will make first&#xD;
           contact on behalf of the study and refer interested mothers to study personnel for&#xD;
           further information and invitation. Upon enrollment into the study, expectant mothers at&#xD;
           approximately 10-14 weeks' gestation will be randomized to receive one of two treatment&#xD;
           regimens of vitamin D3. They will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) Group A: 400 IU&#xD;
           vitamin D3/day-Standard dose treatment of placebo (0 IU vitamin D3) plus prenatal&#xD;
           vitamin (400 IU/day); or (2) Group B: 4,400 IU/day (4,000 IU/2 gummies/day + 400 IU/day&#xD;
           in prenatal). If, after 3 months of vitamin D supplementation, a mother is still frankly&#xD;
           vitamin D deficient (less than 15 ng/ml), she will receive open label active vitamin D&#xD;
           gummies for the remainder of her pregnancy. To attain equal group numbers (n=150) and&#xD;
           balanced numbers by racial/ethnic group (African-American, Caucasian and Hispanic, which&#xD;
           represent the predominant groups delivering at MUSC), a stratified block randomization&#xD;
           will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Race/Ethnicity Defined: Each mother will be asked to define the racial/ethnic group to&#xD;
           which she belongs: (a) African-American, (b) Caucasian, (c) Hispanic, (d) American&#xD;
           Indian, (e) Asian, and (f) other. Because few mothers of American Indian (0.08% of all&#xD;
           deliveries) and Asian (1% of all deliveries) descent deliver at MUSC, there is&#xD;
           insufficient power to include those groups in this study. In addition, the mother, by&#xD;
           self-report, will be asked to define the race/ethnicity of her parents and the father of&#xD;
           the baby and his parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Site Population: The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) is an urban&#xD;
           medical university in Charleston, SC that serves patients predominantly in the&#xD;
           Charleston Tri-County area (80%) and 20% from surrounding regions in South Carolina. We&#xD;
           perform 2000 deliveries each year. The ethnic composition of our obstetrical population&#xD;
           is 57% African American, 36% Caucasian, and 6% Hispanic and 1% Asian. Franklin C. Fetter&#xD;
           and Our Lady of Mercy Clinics primarily see Hispanic patients for prenatal care. These&#xD;
           Hispanics have prenatal care coverage provided by a Roper Hospital, Roper St. Francis&#xD;
           Healthcare, Charleston, SC grant and include approximately 150 deliveries per year at&#xD;
           Roper Hospital. MUSC provides care to any woman presenting in labor who requires routine&#xD;
           care or who is referred from outlying hospitals due to high-risk pregnancy for which&#xD;
           delivery at a Regional Perinatal Center (RPC) is appropriate, regardless of ability to&#xD;
           pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Enrollment and Follow-Up Subjects: The Study Coordinator will be responsible for&#xD;
           assisting in screening, enrollment and follow-up. To maintain data quality, the Study&#xD;
           Coordinator will review every form to check for basic problems such as missing data.&#xD;
           Labor and delivery staff will alert the study coordinator or the Clinical PI's of the&#xD;
           admission of any study subjects. Each month the Study Coordinators will generate a&#xD;
           report on patient recruitment and retention to be reviewed jointly by the research team.&#xD;
           A computer-generated calendar will serve as a reminder to contact recruited patients two&#xD;
           days prior to their appointment. Each month the Study Coordinators will generate a&#xD;
           report on patient recruitment and retention that will be reviewed by Dr. Wagner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up Infant Visit: The Study Coordinator will follow up by phone several times from&#xD;
           birth to 18 months in order to verify subject's contact information. The infant&#xD;
           (accompanied by mother) follow-up visit will take place at MUSC's CTRC Outpatient Clinic&#xD;
           around 18 months postpartum. The infant will have blood drawn for vitamin D and will&#xD;
           have a dental assessment of the primary teeth, including digital photographic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the assistance of Dr. Thomas Hulsey, epidemiologist and co-investigator of this&#xD;
      application, sample size calculations were made. All outcome markers are ratio-scaled and&#xD;
      normally distributed. Because of the possibility of premature delivery and patient attrition&#xD;
      during this study, enrollment of additional subjects over that minimally needed, will provide&#xD;
      a cost effective opportunity to conduct additional analyses examining changes in vitamin D&#xD;
      associated with diet, seasonality, and maternal medical complications. As one of the major&#xD;
      goals of this study is to explore maternal health disparities by ethnicity, the two&#xD;
      supplemented groups (400 and 4,400 IU/day) will be balanced by ethnicity (equal numbers of&#xD;
      Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic). This sampling distribution will be accomplished&#xD;
      by stratified randomization. This sampling frame was selected to provide: (1) sufficient&#xD;
      numbers to examine associations with covariates; (2) the volume of initial and follow up&#xD;
      samples will be manageable by our laboratory; (3) over-samples to compensate for losses to&#xD;
      follow up; and, (4) stabilizes the sophisticated statistical analysis techniques (repeated&#xD;
      measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sources of research material will be maternal interview, history and physicals at clinic&#xD;
      visits, the questionnaires, the lab reports for blood and urine analyses, the dental&#xD;
      periodontal exam results, the dental salivary occult blood results, the vaginal swab results,&#xD;
      the placental pathology report, the medical records of each mother and her infant following&#xD;
      delivery, and the photographic teeth results on the infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material/data that is routinely found in a maternal health record during pregnancy&#xD;
      (including information on past pregnancies and disease history) will be utilized in the&#xD;
      study. There are additional materials and data from questionnaires, blood, urine, saliva,&#xD;
      infant teeth, placental tissue and vaginal samples that will be obtained for research&#xD;
      purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A master list will be stored with study files accessible for clinical intervention only. The&#xD;
      PI and study staff will have access to the master list. All archived samples and samples&#xD;
      provided to collaborating laboratories will be identified with study subject numbers only.&#xD;
      The DNA samples collected will have no recontact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subject's primary care provider(s) will make first contact on behalf of the study&#xD;
      so there is no appearance of a breach in confidentiality. Once a subject has expressed&#xD;
      interest in this research study, to obtain informed consent, one of the study coordinators&#xD;
      will explain to each subject in lay language the purpose, benefits and risks of the&#xD;
      investigation. Consent will be given following an informative discussion period and either by&#xD;
      reading the Informed Consent to the subject or by allowing the subject to read the consent,&#xD;
      then reviewing it with the subject. All study coordinators have taken the Research&#xD;
      Coordinator course and have passed their Miami CITI. Every attempt will be made to conduct&#xD;
      this study in full compliance for the protection of the subjects. For those women who are not&#xD;
      fluent in English and whose first language is Spanish, a Spanish version of the consent form&#xD;
      will be used (translated by BiLingo from IRB approved English consent and submitted as an&#xD;
      amendment to IRB). Following the subject's verbal agreement to participate in the study, the&#xD;
      subject will sign the informed consent; the study coordinator also will sign the consent. A&#xD;
      copy of the signed, written informed consent will be given to the study subject. The original&#xD;
      informed consents will be placed in locked research file in study coordinators' office, 20&#xD;
      Ehrhardt St, #4. A copy of the informed consent also will be placed in the subject's study&#xD;
      binder (located in locked cabinets at same location). A study coordinator note will be placed&#xD;
      in Epic identifying an MUSC woman as participating in a vitamin D and pregnancy RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the investigators have conducted several clinical trials; they are well versed in the&#xD;
      issues of patient/subject confidentiality and have completed the Miami CITI course. They are&#xD;
      nationally and internationally known in their fields. All study coordinators have completed&#xD;
      the Miami CITI and the Research Coordinator course at MUSC. The endeavors of the PI,&#xD;
      co-investigators and study coordinators to maintain subject confidentiality will be ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All maternal blood, urine, and vaginal samples as well as infant blood and placental tissue&#xD;
      will be labeled with the patient's name and medical record number to ensure proper tracking.&#xD;
      Each study subject (and infant) then will be assigned a specific study number without any&#xD;
      reference to the woman or infant's name, which will be used to enter all data into the web&#xD;
      database. We will follow all HIPAA guidelines to maintain protection of patient/subject&#xD;
      information. With these precautions in place, there is a remote risk that the samples and&#xD;
      data could be linked to the woman and her infant; however, the study number and the name will&#xD;
      be kept in a separate file in the locked offices of the study coordinators. The data will be&#xD;
      entered in a secured database with only the study number entered, thus ensuring that the&#xD;
      number and data will be kept separately from the woman and infant's names. All this&#xD;
      information will be kept confidential, and when reported in scientific journals, the&#xD;
      information will not have any identifying information regarding study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should any untoward reaction occur, subjects would receive treatment at the Medical&#xD;
      University of South Carolina. The study will cover the costs of laboratory tests; however,&#xD;
      additional costs of treatment will be the responsibility of the subject as described in the&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study meets the guidelines of clinicaltrials.gov as a clinical trial requiring a Data&#xD;
      Safety and Monitoring Plan and a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. Two of the members of&#xD;
      the Data and Safety and Monitoring committee are scientists external to MUSC well known in&#xD;
      the field of vitamin D metabolism and calcium metabolism. Two of the members are physician&#xD;
      scientists external to MUSC, who are also well known in the field of calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolism. A fifth member will be Dr. Tom Hulsey, epidemiologist at MUSC with considerable&#xD;
      experience serving on the DSMC of other clinical trials. Dr. Hulsey was the chair of the DSMC&#xD;
      of the two prior vitamin D supplementation trials conducted by this study team. He will&#xD;
      maintain the database of the study, follow HIPAA guidelines, and conduct ongoing interim&#xD;
      analyses to ensure that the risk: benefit analyses remain in favor of benefit to the&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): This grant application meets NIH&#xD;
      policy and Guidelines on the inclusion of a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for clinical&#xD;
      trials mL and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html). MUSC as the&#xD;
      Institute and Center (IC) of this grant will have a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (DMSC) in place as outlined in this grant. Two of the members of the DSMC are scientists&#xD;
      external to MUSC well known in the field of vitamin D and calcium metabolism. Two of the&#xD;
      members are physician scientists external to MUSC who also are well known in the field of&#xD;
      calcium and vitamin D metabolism. A fifth member will be Dr. Tom Hulsey, epidemiologist at&#xD;
      MUSC with considerable experience serving on the DSMC of other clinical trials (current and&#xD;
      completed). He will maintain the database of the study, follow HIPAA guidelines, and conduct&#xD;
      ongoing interim analyses to ensure that the risk: benefit analyses remain in favor of benefit&#xD;
      to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Conduct ongoing monitoring of interventional trial by those who have appropriate expertise&#xD;
      to accomplish the trial's mission: The MUSC clinical lab is required to notify the PI of any&#xD;
      critical lab values. The Study Coordinators will be responsible for checking laboratories of&#xD;
      the women within 72 hours of their reporting and then entering the laboratory data into the&#xD;
      computer. They will be provided with a set of normative laboratory values as a reference. The&#xD;
      Clinical PI will review values during the weekly study meeting or will be notified if a value&#xD;
      falls outside of the referent value range. All data will be verified independently by the&#xD;
      Data Processing Center under the direction of Dr. Hulsey. The DSMC will be notified via&#xD;
      telephone and fax with source documents and adverse report sheets if a subject's value falls&#xD;
      outside the referent value range. In addition, all adverse events will be reviewed quarterly&#xD;
      by the DSMC, whose report will be forwarded to the Kellogg Foundation on a quarterly basis&#xD;
      and the IRB yearly. The Investigators will report all Serious Adverse Events by telephone to&#xD;
      the IRB and the DSMC; in addition, the IRB, the DSMC, and Kellogg Foundation will receive a&#xD;
      written report within 10 days of the Clinical Investigators' knowledge of the Event. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will generate a quarterly report to the DSMC regarding subject&#xD;
      enrollment, subject completion, adverse events and serious adverse events. The DSMC will&#xD;
      review the report and a summary letter with their findings sent to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Data Analyses &amp; Monitoring: Interim analyses for the evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      efficacy will be conducted based on the recommendations of the Data Safety &amp; Monitoring&#xD;
      Board. The DSMC will serve to monitor for safety and efficacy. DSMB reports produced by Dr.&#xD;
      Hulsey's team will include summary statistics: on mother recruitment (expected vs. actual),&#xD;
      data form quality (completion and timeliness of forms); tracking of data editing;&#xD;
      demographics of the randomized mothers; aggregate safety; aggregate efficacy; and related&#xD;
      information. The DSMB also will monitor the trial from the standpoint of futility using the&#xD;
      techniques of Lan and Wittes (119).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, differences in losses to follow-up and missed visits will be compared between the six&#xD;
      comparison groups to detect any potential bias (400 IU group stratified by race: African&#xD;
      American, Hispanic and Caucasian; 4000 IU group also stratified by race). The biggest problem&#xD;
      with unbalanced losses will be the loss of statistical power. We will aggressively attempt to&#xD;
      avoid any losses by monitoring adherence to visits. In the event that there are differential&#xD;
      losses between ethnic groups or supplementation groups, we will conduct statistical tests to&#xD;
      ascertain whether these are random or biased. Random losses will be reported but should not&#xD;
      affect outcomes. Biased, or non-random, losses will be assessed on their potential impact on&#xD;
      differences in outcomes. If necessary, we will conduct a propensity score analysis to control&#xD;
      for any statistically significant differences in non-random losses. Following that,&#xD;
      differences in compliance to supplementation will be compared as an 'intent-to-treat' design.&#xD;
      Any significant deviation from protocol will be considered in subsequent analyses. In this&#xD;
      section, we will report on: (1) the deviations from protocol; (2) outcomes comparisons using&#xD;
      an efficacy design to test for true differences associated with subjects who adhered to&#xD;
      protocol; and, (3) outcomes comparison using the intent to treat (effectiveness) design to&#xD;
      test for actual differences that might be expected in a non-controlled intervention. This&#xD;
      will help determine whether this type of supplementation could be expected to be effective if&#xD;
      applied to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, vitamin D levels at study entrance (10-14 weeks' gestational age) will establish the&#xD;
      baseline for each supplementation group. It is expected that at baseline there should not be&#xD;
      any differences between groups. Because we do expect differences between ethnic groups (which&#xD;
      accounts for the stratification), mean vitamin D at baseline will be compared by two-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ethnicity by experimental group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In step 3, using repeated measures analysis of variance, the changes in vitamin D will be&#xD;
      described separately for each ethnic group within each of the supplemented groups. This will&#xD;
      depict separately for each ethnic group the changes in vitamin D over time as a function of&#xD;
      the level of supplementation. This method will reveal how soon after supplementation the&#xD;
      changes in blood (from baseline) are detected, the linear change in blood vitamin D over time&#xD;
      and, when and if a peak level (or plateau) was attained. Adjusted differences will be&#xD;
      examined by use of multiple regression with and without the inclusion of other covariates.&#xD;
      Regression coefficients provide the formula for the linear association between vitamin D in&#xD;
      blood and time, separately for each ethnic group. In the event that there is a non-linear&#xD;
      change over time, appropriate data transformations will occur as necessary. This step also&#xD;
      will provide information on the magnitude of importance that covariates play in changes in&#xD;
      vitamin D over time within each ethnic group. As an example, we may find that seasonality&#xD;
      plays a significant role in changes in vitamin D for Caucasian women but the association is&#xD;
      not as strong for African American women. Further, these associations may become similarly&#xD;
      unimportant at the higher levels of supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next series of analyses will compare the differences in vitamin D between supplemented&#xD;
      groups over time between ethnic groups. This will be accomplished by use of a two-way&#xD;
      (ethnicity and supplementation group) repeated measures analysis of variance. This technique&#xD;
      will detect any significant differences between main effects (ethnic groups and&#xD;
      supplementation groups) and interaction effects (ethnicity by supplementation) in changes in&#xD;
      vitamin D over time. Multiple regression also will be used to examine the changes with and&#xD;
      without the use of potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In secondary analyses, multi-level mixed-effects models will be used to estimate the average&#xD;
      individual monthly rate of change in 25(OH)D, compare this rate between dose groups, and&#xD;
      explore the effects of covariates on the rate of change. These models include fixed effects&#xD;
      for dose group, time, and the group-time interaction, and a random intercept effect, with&#xD;
      additional covariate effects as required. Time will be considered a continuous variable,&#xD;
      measured in months rather than assuming structured visit occurrences. An unstructured&#xD;
      covariance matrix will be assumed. The multi-level modeling approach also will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the longitudinal association between 25(OH)D and the safety parameters calcium, iPTH&#xD;
      (log-transformed), phosphorus, and urinary calcium, creatinine, and calcium: creatinine&#xD;
      levels. The cumulative occurrence of pregnancy complications such as preterm labor and&#xD;
      infection will be compared between dose group levels using logistic regression. All analyses&#xD;
      will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant attrition and missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the primary endpoint of the study is change in 25(OH)D from baseline to delivery, the&#xD;
      primary analysis will be restricted to participants who have remained in the study until&#xD;
      delivery and provided a blood sample within 6 weeks prior to delivery, at delivery, or at the&#xD;
      post-delivery visit (completers-only analysis). Typically, multiple imputations would be used&#xD;
      to impute missing values in support of the favored intention-to-treat analytic approach.&#xD;
      Because the multiple imputation model for this analysis would have required variables also&#xD;
      measured in the final blood sample, however, it cannot be used to impute cases with a missing&#xD;
      final blood sample. Thus, to assess the primary findings' robustness to assumptions about the&#xD;
      missing data, we will perform a sensitivity analysis. Missing data will be imputed under the&#xD;
      following conditions: cases with missing endpoints that experienced no change in both groups;&#xD;
      experienced the group-specific median change observed in completers; experienced no change in&#xD;
      the 400 IU group and minimal change in the 4000 IU group. In the secondary analyses using&#xD;
      multi-level mixed-effects models for longitudinal modeling, all available data points will be&#xD;
      used, as it is not necessary to delete cases with missed timepoints when using this approach.&#xD;
