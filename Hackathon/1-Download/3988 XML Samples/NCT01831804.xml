  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind (subjects and investigators will be&#xD;
      blinded, GSK internal personnel will not be blinded), parallel-group, two part (Part A, Part&#xD;
      B) trial in healthy volunteers and subjects with diabetic foot ulcers. Part A is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate single applications of GSK1278863 in one cohort of healthy volunteers (intact skin)&#xD;
      and approximately 3 cohorts of diabetic subjects. Part B is designed to evaluate first&#xD;
      single, and then repeat applications of GSK1278863 in diabetics, both in the clinic and by&#xD;
      subjects at home. Part B will include approximately 3 cohorts in which the concentration of&#xD;
      drug applied will be determined by pharmacokinetic data from Part A and earlier cohorts in&#xD;
      Part B.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events; or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events; or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Vital Sign Data Outside Clinical Concern Range Following Repeat Dose Administration (Part B)</title>
        <description>Vital sign measurements included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Vital signs were measured after the participants rested in a supine or semi-supine position for 5 minutes prior to the procedure. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). When a high or low value was reported, all values are presented for that time point and parameter.</description>

          <description>Vital sign measurements included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Vital signs were measured after the participants rested in a supine or semi-supine position for 5 minutes prior to the procedure. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles). When a high or low value was reported, all values are presented for that time point and parameter.</description>
