  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing difficulties are common after a stroke and can lead to serious complications like&#xD;
      pneumonia and malnutrition. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatment for improving&#xD;
      swallowing in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous investigations have shown that recovery of swallowing functions occurs from&#xD;
      reorganization (&quot;rewiring&quot;) of the non-involved cerebral hemisphere. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to investigate a new intervention, which combines, swallowing exercises&#xD;
      with brain stimulation targeted to the non-involved cerebral hemisphere, using low intensity&#xD;
      current in acute stroke patients. The investigators plan to assess the safety of this&#xD;
      technique in this patient population and also assess its effect on improving swallowing&#xD;
      functions and swallowing physiology. During this time trial participants will undergo&#xD;
      standardized swallowing and neurological assessments as well as brain MRI scans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairments are a common and a serious complication of stroke but lack effective&#xD;
      therapies. The study investigators herein propose to conduct a prospective clinical study&#xD;
      using a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, anodal transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS), in combination with swallowing exercises for improving dysphagia due to&#xD;
      an acute-subacute hemispheric infarction, and obtain data on safety and effect of 2 different&#xD;
      doses of tDCS, on swallowing physiology and behavior. Dysphagia from hemispheric strokes&#xD;
      occurs due to disruption of the cortical projections to the brainstem swallowing centers&#xD;
      while recovery of swallowing functions have been shown to be mediated via the reorganization&#xD;
      of the swallowing cortex in the unaffected hemisphere. A recent pilot study conducted by the&#xD;
      investigators demonstrated the safety and feasibility of applying 5 consecutive daily&#xD;
      sessions of anodal tDCS for 30 minutes to the swallowing cortex on the unaffected hemisphere&#xD;
      in the acute-subacute stroke phases and showed a promise in improving dysphagia, when&#xD;
      combined with swallowing exercises. The proposed research will be used to further confirm&#xD;
      safety of this technique in early stroke phases and explore alternative, more effective doses&#xD;
      for promoting swallowing recovery prior to its examination in any confirmatory trials. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the study cohort to examine important subject specific parameters&#xD;
      which influence response to the proposed intervention in dysphagic stroke patients. The&#xD;
      overall aim of this study is to gather additional safety data on cumulative sessions of tDCS&#xD;
      in acute-subacute phases of stroke, obtain information about effects of this intervention on&#xD;
      important physiological and clinically relevant swallowing parameters, examine possible dose&#xD;
      effects, and identify candidates who are more likely to benefit from this intervention. The&#xD;
      experience gained from this project will guide planning of future confirmatory trials that&#xD;
      use relevant clinical outcomes to assess potential benefits of this intervention and utilize&#xD;
      important subject specific parameters to refine study inclusion criteria and aid in severity&#xD;
      adjusted analysis.&#xD;

    <measure>To Assess Changes in Penetration and Aspiration</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores will be measured before tDCS and after 5 days after completion of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the Penetration and Aspiration Scale (PAS) scores, a validated 8 point ordinal scale that quantifies penetration and aspiration events observed during Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Evaluation. PAS ranges from 1 (best score) representing no aspiration or penetration to 8 (worst score) representing severe aspiration. An average PAS score will be computed based on 9 swallows for this outcome.</description>

    <measure>To Assess Safety of tDCS in Acute-subacute Stroke Phase: Number of Participants With Neurological Deterioration in Each of the 3 Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 5 days of stimulation sessions</time_frame>
    <description>We will tabulate the number of participants who develop neurological deterioration in the High-dose tDCS, Low-dose tDCS and Sham groups. Neurological deterioration will be defined as an increase in the total National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score by 4 or more points between each successive day. The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. NIHSS ranges from 0 (normal) to 42 (worst possible score). Higher scores mean worse neurological functions.</description>

    <description>We will tabulate the number of participants with deterioration in their motor functions in the High-dose tDCS, Low-dose tDCS and Sham groups. Motor deterioration will be defined as an increase in the motor sub-item of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score by 2 or more points between each successive day of stimulation. The motor sub-item of the NIHSS ranges from 0 (normal) to 16 (worst possible score), with higher scores indicating a worse motor exam.</description>

    <description>We will tabulate the number of participants with swallowing deterioration in the High-dose tDCS, Low-dose tDCS and sham groups Swallowing deterioration will be defined as an increase in the score by 2 or more points in the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). FOIS provides a validated measure of diet level. FOIS is an ordinal scale ranging from 7 (normal diet) to 0 (no oral intake), with lower scores indicating a worse diet.</description>

    <description>The durability of any observed effects of the intervention on dietary status will be estimated by changes in Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) score. FOIS is an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (worst) to 7 (normal oral diet) and provides a reliable measure of dietary intake. The change in FOIS scores across each group will be compared.</description>

    <description>Examining effects of differing doses of anodal tDCS versus sham stimulation on Pharyngeal Constriction Ratio (PCR), derived from videofluoroscopic swallowing studies.PCR is a measure of the pharyngeal area visible in the lateral radiograph view at the point when a bolus is held in the oral cavity divided by the pharyngeal area at the point of maximum pharyngeal constriction during the swallow. A higher PCR indicates a weak swallow leading to increased food residue in the pharynx.</description>

          <description>This is a validated 8 point ordinal scale (range 1-8; score 1 is normal and 8 is the worst possible) that quantifies penetration and aspiration events observed during a videofluroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). All PAS scores were assigned by an independent evaluator blinded to intervention allocation and were based on a standardized VFSS.</description>

PAS ranges from 1 (best score) representing no aspiration or penetration to 8 (worst score) representing severe aspiration. An average PAS score will be computed based on 9 swallows for this outcome.</description>

        <title>To Assess Safety of tDCS in Acute-subacute Stroke Phase: Number of Participants With Neurological Deterioration in Each of the 3 Groups</title>
        <description>We will tabulate the number of participants who develop neurological deterioration in the High-dose tDCS, Low-dose tDCS and Sham groups. Neurological deterioration will be defined as an increase in the total National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score by 4 or more points between each successive day. The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. NIHSS ranges from 0 (normal) to 42 (worst possible score). Higher scores mean worse neurological functions.</description>
