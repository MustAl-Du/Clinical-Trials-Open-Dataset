  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Making Employment Needs&#xD;
      (MEN) Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black&#xD;
      men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with&#xD;
      housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer&#xD;
      case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a&#xD;
      Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach via funding from a National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) R21, in Boston, Massachusetts. A more larger scale, two-armed&#xD;
      quasi-experimental controlled trial design will be used to test MEN Count among Black men&#xD;
      recruited/enrolled from an STD clinic and other community-recruitment methods in Washington,&#xD;
      DC. Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV&#xD;
      [unprotected sex with a woman and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either&#xD;
      current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN&#xD;
      Count, a two-armed quasi-experimental design will be conducted in which participants will&#xD;
      receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in&#xD;
      structure. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes&#xD;
      and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing,&#xD;
      respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and&#xD;
      process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and&#xD;
      delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.&#xD;

    <measure>Condom Use/Unprotected Sex - Redefined as Sexual Risk - 12 Month Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral assessment of the ratio of protected to total number of sex episodes -- changed to sexual risk inclusive of inconsistent condom use in past 90 days + multiple sex partners + sex trade involvement. Very low sexual risk was defined as having one partner and consistent condom use. Low sexual risk was defined as having multiple partners and consistent condom use OR one partner and no/inconsistent condom use. Medium sexual risk was defined as having multiple partners, no/inconsistent condom use and not participating in transactional sex. High risk was defined as having multiple partners, no/inconsistent condom use, and participating in transactional sex. Participants reporting sex with men in the prior 90 days or who reported that they themselves or (one of) their partner(s) was HIV-positive were excluded from the sexual risk outcome given the known differential HIV risk profile for these subpopulations and small numbers of participants in each.</description>

        <title>Condom Use/Unprotected Sex - Redefined as Sexual Risk - 12 Month Follow-up</title>
        <description>Behavioral assessment of the ratio of protected to total number of sex episodes -- changed to sexual risk inclusive of inconsistent condom use in past 90 days + multiple sex partners + sex trade involvement. Very low sexual risk was defined as having one partner and consistent condom use. Low sexual risk was defined as having multiple partners and consistent condom use OR one partner and no/inconsistent condom use. Medium sexual risk was defined as having multiple partners, no/inconsistent condom use and not participating in transactional sex. High risk was defined as having multiple partners, no/inconsistent condom use, and participating in transactional sex. Participants reporting sex with men in the prior 90 days or who reported that they themselves or (one of) their partner(s) was HIV-positive were excluded from the sexual risk outcome given the known differential HIV risk profile for these subpopulations and small numbers of participants in each.</description>

        <title>Condom Use/Unprotected Sex - Redefined as Sexual Risk - 6 Month Follow-up</title>
        <description>Behavioral assessment of the ratio of protected to total number of sex episodes -- changed to sexual risk inclusive of inconsistent condom use in past 90 days + multiple sex partners + sex trade involvement. Very low sexual risk was defined as having one partner and consistent condom use. Low sexual risk was defined as having multiple partners and consistent condom use OR one partner and no/inconsistent condom use. Medium sexual risk was defined as having multiple partners, no/inconsistent condom use and not participating in transactional sex. High risk was defined as having multiple partners, no/inconsistent condom use, and participating in transactional sex. Participants reporting sex with men in the prior 90 days or who reported that they themselves or (one of) their partner(s) was HIV-positive were excluded from the sexual risk outcome given the known differential HIV risk profile for these subpopulations and small numbers of participants in each.</description>
