  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a common invasive cardiovascular procedure&#xD;
      performed in the VA with over 13,000 procedures in FY10. Clopidogrel is a critical adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy following PCI with stent placement and is generally recommended for up to 1 year&#xD;
      following the procedure. Despite the evidence supporting clopidogrel use, studies both&#xD;
      outside and within the VA suggest that poor adherence to clopidogrel is common. However,&#xD;
      prior interventions targeting non-adherence have not specifically focused on clopidogrel&#xD;
      adherence among PCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many potential reasons for early clopidogrel discontinuation that involve patient&#xD;
      and healthcare system factors. Patients reported the following reasons for discontinuing&#xD;
      clopidogrel within 1 month after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation: 1) misunderstanding&#xD;
      the intended treatment duration; 2) conflicting recommendations about intended duration; 3)&#xD;
      cost of the medication; and 4) patients' own decision to stop. In contrast, patients who&#xD;
      continued to take clopidogrel reported the following as helpful: 1) communication such as&#xD;
      letters from their physician; and 2) receiving specific instructions on clopidogrel use.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that there are specific interventions that can be implemented to&#xD;
      improve clopidogrel adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-modal interventions that incorporate frequent follow-up, especially with pharmacists&#xD;
      and use interactive voice response (IVR) technology have improved medication adherence. IVR&#xD;
      technology is a computer-based telephone system which initiates calls, receives calls,&#xD;
      provides information, and collects data from users. IVR is currently a mainstay in the VA&#xD;
      where patients frequently interact with these automated systems to get clinic appointments&#xD;
      and/or refill prescriptions. IVR as part of multi-modal interventions have been well received&#xD;
      by patients, increased adherence to medications (e.g., statins), and improved clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, diabetes symptoms, health status). In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators have successfully used IVR as part of a multi-modal, multi-site intervention&#xD;
      including pharmacists to improve blood pressure levels among hypertensive patients.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators have designed the intervention to improve clopidogrel&#xD;
      adherence that builds on the investigators' prior work and other successful adherence&#xD;
      interventions from the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of a multi-faceted&#xD;
      intervention to improve clopidogrel adherence at VA PCI centers. The investigators will use&#xD;
      the VA's Cardiovascular Assessment Reporting and Tracking (CART-CL), a uniform cath lab&#xD;
      procedure reporting tool at all VA cath labs. The intervention consists of 4 components: a)&#xD;
      an alert from CART-CL will be sent to an inpatient pharmacist prior to discharge that a&#xD;
      patient has received a stent; b) a pharmacist will bring clopidogrel to the patient's bedside&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge as well as educate the patient on the importance of and adherence&#xD;
      to clopidogrel following PCI; c) interactive voice response (IVR) calls will be made to&#xD;
      patients prior to the time of clopidogrel refill to remind patients and to facilitate refills&#xD;
      during follow-up; and d) a Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) member will contact patients who&#xD;
      delay filling clopidogrel.&#xD;

      I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness/implementation study to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a successfully-piloted, evidence-based, multi-faceted intervention to&#xD;
      improve patient adherence to clopidogrel following PCI. The proposed study will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a successfully-piloted, evidence-based, multi-faceted intervention targeting&#xD;
      Veterans following PCI procedure improves adherence to clopidogrel, reduces bleeding,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality among these patients, and is cost-effective. The&#xD;
      proposed intervention will be based on the Chronic Care Model and will build on the&#xD;
      investigators' pilot work as well as will leverage the VA's CART-CL, a uniform cath lab&#xD;
      procedure reporting tool at all VA cath labs. The study will be evaluated using the REAIM&#xD;
      framework consisting of the following components, reach, effectiveness, adoption,&#xD;
      implementation and maintenance. The intervention will adapt elements of prior successful&#xD;
      intervention, including patient education, collaboration between cath lab clinicians and&#xD;
      impatient/outpatient pharmacy teams, and telemonitoring via interactive voice response (IVR)&#xD;
      technology. This type I hybrid effectiveness/implementation study will be tested at 16 sites&#xD;
      randomized to intervention with an average of 90 patients per site per 6 month period versus&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate current practices at VA PCI facilities (n=20) to enhance adherence to&#xD;
           clopidogrel, both at hospital discharge and during longitudinal follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To implement the multi-faceted intervention at 16 total sites through 4 roll-out phases&#xD;
           (4 sites during each roll-out) in a randomized stepped wedge trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation during each roll-out&#xD;
           phase through semi-structured interviews and incorporate lessons learned from each&#xD;
           roll-out phase into subsequent roll-out phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the effectiveness of a successfully-piloted, evidence-based, multi-faceted&#xD;
           intervention versus usual care for improving clopidogrel filling at hospital discharge&#xD;
           and adherence to clopidogrel (primary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the effectiveness of a successfully-piloted, evidence-based, multi-faceted&#xD;
           intervention versus usual care for reducing the combined cardiovascular endpoints of&#xD;
           bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of the successfully-piloted,&#xD;
           evidence-based, multi-faceted intervention compared with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have successfully piloted the intervention to improve clopidogrel adherence&#xD;
      following PCI. The investigators developed a software application integrated within CART-CL&#xD;
      that assessed whether patients fill their clopidogrel prescription at hospital discharge. If&#xD;
      clopidogrel was not filled, patients were contacted to identify barriers to medication&#xD;
      filling. During follow-up, automated telephone calls were sent to patients to educate them&#xD;
      about the importance of medication adherence and to remind them to refill clopidogrel prior&#xD;
      to the refill due date. The software application successfully identified all 15 patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the pilot who underwent PCI and whether they filled clopidogrel at hospital&#xD;
      discharge at 2 VAMCs. In qualitative interviews about the automated calls, all patients&#xD;
      indicated that the refill reminder messages were helpful. A majority of participants&#xD;
      indicated that they felt the education/support from the messages or participation in the&#xD;
      study was helpful or would be helpful to others. A few patients shared that the messages also&#xD;
      supported refilling other medications and reminding them to ask clarifying questions about&#xD;
      other medications. Following the successful pilot, the investigators' next step is to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the intervention and study the implementation process across a range of&#xD;
      VA facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on the prior work and evidence from the literature, the investigators have developed&#xD;
      the intervention informed by the Chronic Care Model (CCM) which is a framework that uses&#xD;
      clinical information systems to facilitate evidence-based quality improvement. The&#xD;
      investigators will leverage CART-CL, IVR technology, patient self-management, and team-based&#xD;
      care to foster efficient, productive interactions between activated patients and proactive&#xD;
      clinical teams to improve clopidogrel adherence. Further the components of the intervention&#xD;
      directly address many of the reasons that patients have highlighted as leading to early&#xD;
      clopidogrel discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will refine the current state of knowledge on improving medication adherence in&#xD;
      multiple ways. First, it combines multiple interventions that have been separately shown to&#xD;
      be effective in improving medication adherence and addresses causes of clopidogrel&#xD;
      non-adherence identified by patients. Second, the intervention focuses on a novel setting&#xD;
      (i.e., patients discharged following PCI and transitioning to outpatient care) in contrast to&#xD;
      prior adherence interventions that have focused only on patients with stable chronic diseases&#xD;
      (e.g., hypertension). Prior work by the investigators' group and others suggest that the&#xD;
      immediate post-ACS period, and more generally transitions from the inpatient to the&#xD;
      outpatient setting, are particularly 'vulnerable periods' for medication adherence. Yet prior&#xD;
      interventions have not specifically targeted this setting. Third, the targeted medication in&#xD;
      this study has demonstrated short-term benefits and where non-adherence can have immediate&#xD;
      adverse outcomes (e.g., stent thrombosis). Prior studies have focused on medications (e.g.,&#xD;
      hypertension medications) where non-adherence leads to problems longer term rather than the&#xD;
      short term. Fourth, the study utilizes existing resources (i.e., cardiac data systems&#xD;
      integrated with the VA electronic health record, VA pharmacists and patient-aligned care&#xD;
      teams) to implement the intervention, improving the feasibility of broader implementation.&#xD;
      Prior adherence interventions have generally required significant additional resources and&#xD;
      the majority of quality improvement interventions are not continued following the end of the&#xD;
      research project. This proposal will extend the current state of knowledge on medication&#xD;
      adherence by demonstrating that a successful intervention will need multiple evidence-based&#xD;
      components, and designed with plans for implementation in mind. Finally, this study is being&#xD;
      conducted as a type I hybrid implementation study and therefore includes extensive study of&#xD;
      the implementation process, which will yield both contributions to implementation science and&#xD;
      facilitate wider dissemination if the intervention is found to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study will make two important contributions to implementation science.&#xD;
      First, the investigators will integrate a structured survey, the organizational readiness to&#xD;
      change assessment (ORCA), for use in the formative and summative evaluations (described&#xD;
      further in the evaluation plan). The ORCA has previously been psychometrically validated and&#xD;
      found to predict implementation effectiveness. However, it has not been previously tested as&#xD;
      a tool to support implementation. Findings from this study will help us understand if and how&#xD;
      the ORCA can be used to support other implementation projects, and will contribute to users'&#xD;
      materials for the survey. Second, the investigators are using an innovative study design, a&#xD;
      randomized stepped wedge design, and building-in iterative formative evaluation to guide&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention at sites in subsequent cohorts. As far as the&#xD;
      investigators know, this kind of iterative rollout design with planned formative evaluation&#xD;
      has not been used in an effectiveness/implementation hybrid study. If it works as planned,&#xD;
      and provides useful formative evaluation findings from early cohorts, it may represent an&#xD;
      important adaptation of the hybrid design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of VA patient care, if the intervention is successful, it will increase adherence to&#xD;
      clopidogrel by helping patients take their anti-platelet medication routinely as prescribed,&#xD;
      the quality of cardiovascular care for Veterans since adherence to clopidogrel has been&#xD;
      associated with reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality following PCI, and the&#xD;
      efficiency of care by using telephone calls and telemonitoring for communication with&#xD;
      patients rather than clinic visits. This study will leverage the automated pharmacy system&#xD;
      and tele-monitoring technology for which the VA is a nationally recognized leader. Further,&#xD;
      the study will address an important gap in knowledge (i.e., how to improve adherence to&#xD;
      clopidogrel medications following PCI) and the findings can inform future interventions to&#xD;
      improve adherence to other chronic cardiovascular medications. Finally, since the study is&#xD;
      designed to be implemented using existing personnel/staff and current national platforms&#xD;
      (i.e., CART-CL and PACT teamlets), it will be generalizable to other VA Medical Centers and&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
