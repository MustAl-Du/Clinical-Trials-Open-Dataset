  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5,200 people will participate per year. The study population will include&#xD;
      females and males over 5 years of age who live in filariasis and onchocerciasis endemic&#xD;
      areas. Subject selection will not be based on health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sites will be studied, and each study will last for 4 years. Participants will be studied&#xD;
      only once in cross-sectional surveys. Some subjects may be included in more than one annual&#xD;
      population survey, but this is not a longitudinal study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare annual and semiannual mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic&#xD;
      filariasis and onchocerciasis, and investigators will compare the impact of these MDA&#xD;
      schedules on soil transmitted helminth infections. MDA will be administered by others&#xD;
      (Liberian Ministry of Health or Liberian Institute of Biomedical Research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that semiannual mass drug administration (MDA) is&#xD;
      superior to annual MDA for elimination of lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and for&#xD;
      control of soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the relative impact and cost effectiveness of annual vs. twice yearly mass drug&#xD;
           administration (MDA) for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the relative impact and cost effectiveness of annual vs. twice yearly mass drug&#xD;
           administration (MDA) for elimination of onchocerciasis in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the impact of annual vs. semiannual MDA on soil transmitted helminth (STH)&#xD;
           infection in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation Activities (2019/2020):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional one-time cross-sectional surveys will be completed in the Harper site in Maryland&#xD;
      district in 2019 and in Lofa in 2020 to measure the long-term impact of MDA on W. bancrofti,&#xD;
      O. volvulus, and on STH infection parameters following these cumulative 7-9 rounds of MDA&#xD;
      since the baseline survey taken in 2013. Since the last DOLF surveys (3rd follow-ups) in&#xD;
      these sites in 2016 &amp; 2017, respectively, there have been a total of 3 annual rounds of MDA&#xD;
      in both areas. These additional surveys will recruit 2,500 participants in the Maryland area&#xD;
      villages and 3,200 in the Lofa area villages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a deforming and disabling infectious disease that causes&#xD;
      elephantiasis and genital deformity (especially hydroceles). The infection affects some 120&#xD;
      million people in 81 countries in tropical and subtropical regions with well over 1 billion&#xD;
      people at risk of acquiring the disease [1]. LF is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia&#xD;
      spp. (B. malayi and B.timori), nematode parasites that are transmitted by mosquitoes. This&#xD;
      study is based on the assumption that currently used MDA regimens and schedules are not&#xD;
      optimal for achieving elimination of LF. These regimens (either annual Albendazole (Alb) 400&#xD;
      mg plus diethylcarbamazine 6 mg/kg or Alb 400 mg plus Ivermectin (Iver) 200 Âµg/kg for LF)&#xD;
      were introduced more than 10 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onchocerciasis (&quot;Oncho&quot;) is similar in some ways to LF in that it is a vector-borne nematode&#xD;
      parasitic disease that causes severe disability. In contrast to LF, this disease causes&#xD;
      blindness and severe skin disease rather than elephantiasis, and it is spread by black flies&#xD;
      instead of mosquitoes. O. volvulus adult worms live in subcutaneous nodules while the adult&#xD;
      worms of the LF parasites live in lymphatic vessels. O. volvulus adult worms are larger and&#xD;
      less sensitive to available drug treatments than those of the species that cause LF and have&#xD;
      a longer lifespan (approximately 14 years rather than the estimated 7 years for LF&#xD;
      parasites). More effective drugs or dosing schedules for MDA against Oncho could shorten the&#xD;
      number of years needed to interrupt Oncho transmission in areas that previously had high&#xD;
      disease rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs used for LF MDA are also active against soil transmitted helminth infections (STH,&#xD;
      e.g., Ascaris, Hookworm, and Trichuris). De-worming campaigns using anthelmintics usually&#xD;
      target special groups of the population, such as schoolchildren, and have limited impact on&#xD;
      transmission. Treatment of the total population and semiannual treatments may reduce&#xD;
      re-infection considerably and will most likely lead to reduced infection densities and&#xD;
      infection prevalence rates. Suppression of STH is an important ancillary benefit of MDA&#xD;
      programs for filarial infections. Increasingly control programs for filariasis and STH are&#xD;
      being integrated with programs for other parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis. For this&#xD;
      reason, participants will also be tested for schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The study aims to compare the effectiveness once yearly (1X) versus twice yearly&#xD;
      (2X) mass drug administration (MDA) for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis,&#xD;
      onchocerciasis and for control of soil-transmitted helminth infections (intestinal parasites)&#xD;
      in large populations. Mass drug administration will be provided by the Liberian Ministry of&#xD;
      Health. This project will assess the impact of the government's public health program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Study procedures include collection of finger prick blood that will be tested for&#xD;
      microfilariae by microscopy and for serology testing (antigenemia and antibody testing). Skin&#xD;
      snips will be collected and examined by microscopy for the presence of Onchocerca&#xD;
      microfilariae. Stool samples will be collected for detection of parasitic worm eggs by&#xD;
      microscopy. All assays will be performed in Liberia (filarial serology tests, microfilaria&#xD;
      testing, stool examinations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washington University researchers developed the protocol, will provide training and guidance&#xD;
      to Liberian researchers, and work with them to analyze the data. Liberian researchers will&#xD;
      consent the participants, obtain blood, skin and stool specimens, perform laboratory tests on&#xD;
      the specimens, and enter data on participants and lab results.&#xD;
