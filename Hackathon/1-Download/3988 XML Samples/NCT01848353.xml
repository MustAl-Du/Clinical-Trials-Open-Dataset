  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among youth populations, American Indians have the highest prevalence of diabetes in the&#xD;
      United States. This study will use exercise as the principal lifestyle modification approach&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of diabetes in this population. The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma has several&#xD;
      excellent, but underutilized wellness facilities in their Health Services Area in rural&#xD;
      Southeast Oklahoma, a low socioeconomic region. It has been established that exercise lowers&#xD;
      diabetes risk, and many overweight/obese, insulin resistant American Indian youth who live in&#xD;
      this region would benefit from an increase in regular exercise. The challenge is to modify&#xD;
      behavior so that routine exercise is established and maintained. The proposed study will test&#xD;
      whether monetary incentives can elicit greater frequency and duration of exercise in American&#xD;
      Indian youth when transportation and access barriers are reduced.&#xD;

      Study participants in the intervention arm of the study will be asked to exercise on 3 days&#xD;
      per week for 48 weeks. Clinical and physical assessments will be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      after 16, 32 and 48 weeks. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups. Each group&#xD;
      will receive payment for exercise sessions completed but one group will be on a fixed&#xD;
      schedule of compensation and the other will have a schedule that incentivizes frequency or&#xD;
      duration of exercise. In addition, two reference groups of age-matched participants who are&#xD;
      normal weight and subclassified as having either low or high levels of physical activity and&#xD;
      fitness will be tested. The reference groups will complete baseline tests and will not enter&#xD;
      the exercise intervention program.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at baseline (week 0) and weeks 16, 32, and 48.</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency and duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity will be measured using heart rate monitors. The monitors will be worn each exercise session. Participants are asked to complete 3 exercise sessions per week throughout the 48-week period of enrollment. The primary comparison between the experimental and active comparator groups will be the volume of exercise (total time) accumulated. Comparisons will be made for accumulated exercise volume at 16, 32, and 48 weeks and the change from baseline (week 0).</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment for the exercise intervention was July 2013 - April 2016. Recruitment for the reference group was July 2015 - April 2017. All participants were were recruited from medical clinics, schools, or community settings in Southeast Oklahoma.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>142 people enrolled (completed informed consent). During screening, 4 OW/Ob and 8 NW people were disqualified, and 5 OW/Ob and 5 NW people voluntarily withdrew. Baseline data were thus available for 120 people. After baseline testing was complete, 81 OW/Ob participants were randomly assigned to either standard pay or incentive group for Phase 1.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Frequency and duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity will be measured using heart rate monitors. The monitors will be worn each exercise session. Participants are asked to complete 3 exercise sessions per week throughout the 48-week period of enrollment. The primary comparison between the experimental and active comparator groups will be the volume of exercise (total time) accumulated. Comparisons will be made for accumulated exercise volume at 16, 32, and 48 weeks and the change from baseline (week 0).</description>

In weeks 33-48 (phase 3)participants in this arm will receive fewer financial incentives than in the prior 32 weeks but they will be delivered through a raffle system to utilize a variable reinforcement approach. All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the active comparator group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.&#xD;

          <title>Change From Baseline in Volume of Exercise (Total Time)</title>
          <description>Frequency and duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity will be measured using heart rate monitors. The monitors will be worn each exercise session. Participants are asked to complete 3 exercise sessions per week throughout the 48-week period of enrollment. The primary comparison between the experimental and active comparator groups will be the volume of exercise (total time) accumulated. Comparisons will be made for accumulated exercise volume at 16, 32, and 48 weeks and the change from baseline (week 0).</description>
          <population>In Phase 1, 81 people were randomized, but 4 withdrew after assignment so 77 people had exercise behavior data for analyses. In Phase 2, 51 were randomized, but 5 withdrew after assignment, leaving 46 for behavior analyses. In Phase 3, 15 were randomized, 2 withdrew after assignment, leaving 13 for behavior analyses.</population>

          <description>All participants will perform exercise training. Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise session lasting at least 20 minutes during weeks 1-16 (phase 1). All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the experimental group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.&#xD;
Exercise training: All participants will perform exercise training at the wellness center. Exercise duration and intensity will be recorded with heart rate monitors.</description>

          <title>Normal Weight, Low Activity Group</title>
          <description>This group of participants will complete only the baseline tests and assessments and will serve as a reference group. They will be selected to have low physical activity and fitness like the intervention group. Therefore differences in their results with the intervention group will reflect the effects of overweight/obesity on the variables of interest.</description>

          <description>This group of participants will complete only the baseline tests and assessments and will serve as a reference group. They will be selected to have higher physical activity and fitness than the intervention group. They will therefore serve as a healthy reference group and differences in their results with the intervention group will reflect the effects of both overweight/obesity and physical activity on the variables of interest.</description>
