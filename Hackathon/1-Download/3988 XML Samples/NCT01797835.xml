  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening youth in the primary care setting is one way to identify adolescents who may be&#xD;
      at-risk for future alcohol problems. The current study tests the new NIAAA screening guide&#xD;
      questions, which ask about friend and adolescent drinking, to see how well these questions&#xD;
      work to predict subsequent alcohol use, problems, and involvement in other risk behaviors,&#xD;
      such as sexual risk-taking and delinquency. In addition, the investigators plan to provide a&#xD;
      brief motivational intervention for some at-risk teens and see whether alcohol use differs&#xD;
      for those teens who receive the intervention and those teens who receive enhanced usual care.&#xD;
      The results of this study have the potential to significantly impact the standard of care for&#xD;
      identifying and intervening with at- risk youth in primary care settings.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>this study included an examination of screening; thus, not all youth were part of the randomized controlled trial as they screened in at low risk. This is why there is a larger N for the overall sample. The 294 are the youth that screened in as at-risk who were then part of the RCT.</pre_assignment_details>
