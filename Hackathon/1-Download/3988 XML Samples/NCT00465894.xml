  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if long acting tolterodine confers more benefit&#xD;
      than intravaginal low dose estrogen in the treatment of Overactive Bladder Syndrome at 12&#xD;
      weeks post-treatment initiation. The hypothesis is that low dose intra-vaginal estrogen&#xD;
      confers greater benefit than tolterodine in the treatment of Overactive Bladder symptoms.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes were to assess if the addition of the other therapy to the treatment&#xD;
      regimen conferred benefit at 24 weeks and 52 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract bladder storage symptoms include urinary frequency, urinary urgency,&#xD;
      nocturia and urge incontinence. Overactive Bladder (OAB)Syndrome is a condition in which&#xD;
      urgency is the predominant symptom with or without urge incontinence and is usually&#xD;
      accompanied by frequency and nocturia. The mainstay of treatment of women with OAB syndrome&#xD;
      is treatment with anticholinergic medication as well as behavioral therapy. This method of&#xD;
      treatment has demonstrated a 60% response rate as reported in the Cochrane Database of&#xD;
      Systemic Reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to anticholinergic therapy, vaginal atrophy is often corrected as part of a&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment plan. Vaginal atrophy is a condition this is vastly prevalent in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women. It is thought to affect up to 48% of post-menopausal women. Many women&#xD;
      with this condition experience vaginal dryness, irritation, painful intercourse, as well as&#xD;
      urinary symptoms including dysuria, urgency, frequency, nocturia, incontinence and recurrent&#xD;
      urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Tolterodine LA compared to low dose intra-vaginal estrogen cream for the&#xD;
      treatment of OAB symptoms&#xD;

    <description>Assessment measured using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), patient perception of improvement. The PGI-I is a transition scale that is a single question asking the patient to rate their urinary tract condition now, as compared with how it was prior to before beginning treatment on a scale from 1 being very much better to 7 being very much worse.&#xD;
Frequencies of each response was reported. Each level achieved (movement towards 1), is considered an improvement.</description>

The PSQ consists of a single question, &quot;How satisfied are you with your progress since your treatment&quot; in which the 3 possible responses are &quot;completely satisfied,&quot; &quot;somewhat satisfied,&quot; and &quot;not satisfied.&quot; The goal of treatment was to move all participants to &quot;completely satisfied.</description>

        <description>This was measured using the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). The PSQ consists of a single question, &quot;How satisfied are you with your progress since your treatment&quot; in which the 3 possible responses are &quot;completely satisfied,&quot; &quot;somewhat satisfied,&quot; and &quot;not satisfied.&quot; The goal of treatment was to move all participants to &quot;completely satisfied.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline through 12 Weeks of Intervention</time_frame>
        <population>In Group 1, we were unable to analyze 5 patients and in Group 2 we were unable to analyze 3 patients. For this outcome ONLY, 1 patient from each Group were not available to obtain the measurements from this questionnaire. Therefore the overall number of participants analyzed for this outcome is less than other outcomes. Please see Participant Flow.</population>

The PSQ consists of a single question, &quot;How satisfied are you with your progress since your treatment&quot; in which the 3 possible responses are &quot;completely satisfied,&quot; &quot;somewhat satisfied,&quot; and &quot;not satisfied.&quot; The goal of treatment was to move all participants to &quot;completely satisfied.</description>

        <population>At 24 weeks, only 14 patients from Group 1 &amp; 2 had complete data sets. Those without complete data sets were not included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>Assessment measured using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), patient perception of improvement. The PGI-I is a transition scale that is a single question asking the patient to rate their urinary tract condition now, as compared with how it was prior to before beginning treatment on a scale from 1 being very much better to 7 being very much worse. Each level achieved(movement towards 1), is considered an improvement.</description>
