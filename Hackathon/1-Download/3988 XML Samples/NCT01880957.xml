      The primary aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding potential (BP) in vivo in bipolar&#xD;
           disorder patients (BPD) during a major depressive episode (MDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HT1A BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the effect of lamotrigine treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of unipolar depression on 5-HTT BP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET and MRI imaging will be used to investigate the aims described above in patients who have&#xD;
      bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and are currently experiencing a depressive episode.&#xD;
      Both healthy controls and depressed participants with bipolar disorder or unipolar depression&#xD;
      will be recruited. Patients who are on medication before enrolling in the study will have a&#xD;
      three week washout. At baseline, healthy controls and patients will have an MRI consisting of&#xD;
      both structural and functional sequences. Psychological measures will also be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline. Within one week of the MRI, both patients and healthy controls will have one CUMI&#xD;
      and one DASB PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline PET scans, patient participants will begin medication treatment with&#xD;
      either lithium or lamotrigine, based on the clinical judgement of the treating psychiatrist.&#xD;
      Psychological measures will be obtained every 2 weeks. After 6 weeks of medication treatment&#xD;
      at a therapeutic dose, patients will be assessed for remission (defined as a 50% decrease in&#xD;
      the HDRS score from baseline). If this criteria is met, patient participants will then have&#xD;
      follow-up PET scans (one CUMI and one DASB). If this criteria is not met, the patient will be&#xD;
      switched to the other medication under study and will be reevaluated after an additional 4&#xD;
      weeks of medication treatment. Patients who still do not demonstrate a 50% decrease in their&#xD;
      HDRS will be considered non-responders and will have repeat CUMI and DASB scans.&#xD;

    <measure>Post-Lithium Treatment Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-24 (HDRS) score obtained at baseline. Minimum score 0, maximum possible score 75; the higher the score on the scale, the more severe the degree of depression. Participants must have an HDRS score of at least 15 to be eligible. After eight weeks of medication treatment, the HDRS score will be reevaluated with the HDRS-24 (and rescanned with PET and MRI). Participants who have a 50% or greater decrease in their HDRS-24 score will be considered responders (to Lithium treatment).</description>

    <measure>Prediction of Treatment Response</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measures were generated following LASSO linear regression analysis using pretreament HDRS-24 AND..&#xD;
pre-treatment 5-HTT OR&#xD;
pretreatment 5-HT1A OR&#xD;
the combination of both 5-HTT and 5-HT1A binding potential&#xD;
to predict post-treatment response defined by a dichotomous remission status variable (remitter vs. non-remitter, where remitter is defined a priori by HDRS-24 &lt;10 post-treatment and a reduction of greater than or equal to 50% in HDRS-24 pre-to-post treatment). Outcome measure is reported as percent accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity in predicting remitter status outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Group Differences in 5-HTT Binding Potential</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in mean of 5-HTT binding potential between patients with depression pre-treatment, post-treatment, compared to healthy volunteers. Broadly, binding potential is defined as the ratio of the tracer concentration in tissue to the free plasma concentration. It is a measure of the density of &quot;available&quot; targets (e.g. 5-HTT) &amp; the affinity of the ligand (tracer) to that target.</description>

The analyzed population here must have completed both pre- and post-treatment scans for BOTH 5-HTT and 5-HT1A and have 8 weeks of HDRS-24 followup so the predictive power of each individual tracer could be assessed as well as the combination of the two tracers. This is a smaller population that each tracer individually or the outcome of the HDRS-24 scale alone.</population>

to predict post-treatment response defined by a dichotomous remission status variable (remitter vs. non-remitter, where remitter is defined a priori by HDRS-24 &lt;10 post-treatment and a reduction of greater than or equal to 50% in HDRS-24 pre-to-post treatment). Outcome measure is reported as percent accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity in predicting remitter status outcomes.</description>
          <population>Remission status prediction by groups: accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The analyzed population here must have completed both pre- and post-treatment scans for BOTH 5-HTT and 5-HT1A and have 8 weeks of HDRS-24 followup so the predictive power of each individual tracer could be assessed as well as the combination of the two tracers. This is a smaller population that each tracer individually or the outcome of the HDRS-24 scale alone.</population>

        <description>Differences in mean of 5-HTT binding potential between patients with depression pre-treatment, post-treatment, compared to healthy volunteers. Broadly, binding potential is defined as the ratio of the tracer concentration in tissue to the free plasma concentration. It is a measure of the density of &quot;available&quot; targets (e.g. 5-HTT) &amp; the affinity of the ligand (tracer) to that target.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Limitations include: 1. a small sample size, which precludes investigation into interaction factors (e.g. sex/BPD subtype); 2. a short washout duration (3 weeks for ethical reasons), which may not be sufficient to abate treatment effects; 3. scans for both patients and controls conducted across multiple sites, though, importantly, all pre- and post-treatment scans within-participant were conducted at the same site.</limitations_and_caveats>
