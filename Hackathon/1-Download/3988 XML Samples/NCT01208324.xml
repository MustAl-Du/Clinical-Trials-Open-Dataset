    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of estrogen and serotonin on cognition,&#xD;
      emotional processing, and brain activation. The investigators will study the effects of acute&#xD;
      tryptophan (TRP) depletion on cognition and mood in healthy menopausal women before and after&#xD;
      estrogen replacement treatment (ERT). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the&#xD;
      investigators will identify differences in brain activation during memory tasks with and&#xD;
      without TRP depletion and before and after estrogen therapy in order to determine which brain&#xD;
      regions and cognitive functions are affected by each manipulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this study is to further our understanding of the individual and&#xD;
      interactive effects of the hormone estrogen and the neurotransmitter serotonin on certain&#xD;
      aspects of cognition and brain activation in menopausal women ages 48 to 60 years. Women will&#xD;
      undergo cognitive testing and fMRI sessions both before and after 6 weeks of either estrogen&#xD;
      or placebo administration. We will recruit women who are across the first 10 years since&#xD;
      their last menstrual period so that the investigators can gather information regarding the&#xD;
      potential impact of time since menopause on our outcomes of interest. We anticipate that&#xD;
      findings from this study will help scientist and clinicians to refine their use of estrogen&#xD;
      therapy in menopausal women. In addition, should the role of serotonin be of utmost&#xD;
      importance for maintenance of healthy cognition, these data aid future drug development to&#xD;
      preserve health cognition and/or to treat dementias in which serotonin is an important&#xD;
      factor. This proposal is both novel and timely as results from this study are likely to&#xD;
      provide information critical to the on-going discussion regarding the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      ET use in menopausal women.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To replicate and extend our previous behavioral findings of an interaction between estrogen therapy (ET) and tryptophan depletion on verbal memory in a group of early menopausal women randomized to receive ET. Blood-oxygen-level dependent or BOLD signal is the outcome of BOLD imaging, which is a technique used in functional MRI. BOLD signal reflects changes in regional cerebral blood flow which delineate regional activity. A positive BOLD signal marks an increase in regional blood flow, while a negative BOLD signal marks a decrease in regional blood flow. A positive percent change means that between scans the BOLD signal i.e. blood flow in that region has increased, a negative percent change means that the BOLD signal has decreased between scans.</description>

    <description>150 subjects will be enrolled in a double blind placebo controlled study where they will be randomized to receive either treatment with 17β-estradiol (Vivelle Dot® 0.10 - 0.15 mg/day) or a look-alike placebo patch for a total of approximately 8 weeks. There will be four fMRI test sequences: two test sequences one week apart prior to estrogen treatment (ET) or placebo treatment (PT), and two sequences one week apart following approximately 6-weeks of double-blind ET or PT. During each test day, all subjects will have their blood drawn at specific time intervals and undergo a battery of cognitive testing.While on the ET or PT treatment, all subjects will be instructed to change the patch every 3.5 days.</description>

             estrogen-based localized treatments such as creams and vaginal inserts will be&#xD;
             permissible, so long as said treatments do not effect systemic estrogen levels (women&#xD;
             using localized treatments must have estrogen levels similar to other women in the&#xD;
             study of their age and menopause status). PI will have final decision about enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Are pregnant (pertains to peri-menopausal women only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 1: In the case of participants with full or partial hysterectomy, timing of final&#xD;
        menstrual period will be determined by Dr. Epperson (the study PI) or one of the study MDs.&#xD;
        In cases in which final menstrual period cannot be established, subjects will be excluded&#xD;
        from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 2: Women who undergo the repeat FSH blood test will be enrolled if their levels are &gt;&#xD;
        30. Women will not be required to repeat all admission procedures unless they report&#xD;
        experiencing a life event which would impact their mental or physical health and&#xD;
        well-being. The PI will make the final determination regarding what, if any, screening&#xD;
        procedures need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 3: Women on localized estrogen treatments who show elevated systemic estrogen levels&#xD;
        will not be enrolled. Instead, they will need to discontinue use for 1 month and then have&#xD;
        their estrogen levels retested with an additional blood draw. PI will have the final&#xD;
        decision regarding eligibility.&#xD;

          <title>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionaire</title>
          <description>The ACE is used to assess history of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, childhood neglect, and household dysfunction. The number of exposures was summed to create the ACE score (range: 0-10). Subjects with an ACE score ⩾2 were considered 'high ACE' while subjects with ACE score of &lt; 2 were considered 'low ACE'. A threshold of 2 was used to define the high ACE group based on studies of depression prevalence in later life that demonstrate increased susceptibility at this level of exposure.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in BOLD Signal</title>
        <description>To replicate and extend our previous behavioral findings of an interaction between estrogen therapy (ET) and tryptophan depletion on verbal memory in a group of early menopausal women randomized to receive ET. Blood-oxygen-level dependent or BOLD signal is the outcome of BOLD imaging, which is a technique used in functional MRI. BOLD signal reflects changes in regional cerebral blood flow which delineate regional activity. A positive BOLD signal marks an increase in regional blood flow, while a negative BOLD signal marks a decrease in regional blood flow. A positive percent change means that between scans the BOLD signal i.e. blood flow in that region has increased, a negative percent change means that the BOLD signal has decreased between scans.</description>

          <description>Participants assigned to receive the Active ET patch, and sequence of active tryptophan followed by sham tryptophan. There will be four successful* TRP depletion test sequences: two test sequences one week apart prior to randomization to ET or PT, and two sequences one week apart following approximately 6-weeks of double-blind ET or PT. Each TRP depletion test day will involve ingestion of 70 capsules. During one of each pair of tests, the 70 capsules will contain 31.5 g of lactose (sham depletion; for participants who are not lactose intolerant) or 31.5 g of microcellulose (sham depletion; for participants who have mild to moderate lactose intolerance), while during the other test they will contain a total of 31.5 g of amino acids, but no tryptophan.</description>
