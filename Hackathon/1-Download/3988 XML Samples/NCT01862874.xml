    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of V501 (quadrivalent Human Papilloma Virus&#xD;
      [HPV] [Type 6, 11, 16 and 18] L1 Virus-Like Particle vaccine, GARDASIL™) in healthy, 16- to&#xD;
      26-year old Japanese males. The hypotheses tested are: 1) V501 reduces the combined incidence&#xD;
      of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection compared with placebo, and 2) V501&#xD;
      reduces the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection,&#xD;
      condyloma acuminata, penile/perianal/perineal intraepithelial neoplasia, or penile, perianal,&#xD;
      or perineal cancer compared with placebo.&#xD;

    <description>Persistent infection was defined as 1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive to HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in 2 consecutive anogenital or biopsy samples collected ≥4 months apart, or 2) Pathology Panel consensus diagnosis of condyloma acuminate, penile/perianal/perineal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), penile, perianal, or perineal cancer and PCR detection of HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in an adjacent section and PCR positive for the same HPV type at a separate adjacent visit. The combined incidence of HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 persistent infection detected in samples from ≥2 consecutive visits ≥6 months apart was assessed.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (erythema, pain, and swelling) was summarized.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 15 days after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. Vaccine-related AEs are those that were deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to vaccine administration by the investigator. The percentage of participants with a vaccine-related systemic AE was summarized.</description>

    <description>Persistent infection was defined as 1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive to HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in 2 consecutive anogenital or biopsy samples collected ≥4 months apart, or 2) Pathology Panel consensus diagnosis of condyloma acuminate, penile/perianal/perineal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), penile, perianal, or perineal cancer and PCR detection of HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in an adjacent section and PCR positive for the same HPV type at a separate adjacent visit. The incidence of persistent infection detected in samples from ≥2 consecutive visits ≥6 months apart was assessed. Disease was defined as HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18-related condyloma acuminate, PIN, penile, perianal, or perineal cancer. The combined incidence of HPV Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 persistent infection or disease was assessed.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Injection-site Adverse Event Prompted on the Vaccination Report Card</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (erythema, pain, and swelling) was summarized.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study drug or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE.
