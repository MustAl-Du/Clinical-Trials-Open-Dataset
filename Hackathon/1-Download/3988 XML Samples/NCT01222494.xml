  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US prevalence of childhood-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes, both predictors of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, have increased to epidemic proportions in recent decades. Children with&#xD;
      mental illness, especially those treated with antipsychotic medications, are at additional&#xD;
      risk for obesity (adiposity) and related risk conditions. A variety of noninvasive techniques&#xD;
      to assess cardiometabolic risk have begun to be applied in children, including body&#xD;
      composition measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), carotid intima media&#xD;
      thickness (CIMT) measured by ultrasound, and hepatic triglyceride content measured using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (PDFF). These measures&#xD;
      allow for the early, noninvasive study of adiposity-related metabolic risk. The overall aim&#xD;
      of this two-study research plan is to characterize the level of measurable risk using these&#xD;
      sensitive markers in treated and untreated children with mental health disorders, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the magnitude of change in risk that can be observed using these biomarkers in&#xD;
      children receiving a well established behavioral weight-loss intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will utilize sensitive, early biomarkers of disease risk, including whole body&#xD;
      adiposity with DEXA, PDDF and CIMT, directly relevant to diabetes and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk. The primary goals of this study are to deliver an evidence-based weight loss&#xD;
      intervention to the population of youth who are overweight or obese as a result of&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment, to characterize metabolic risk associated with weight using&#xD;
      sensitive biomarkers, and to evaluate the magnitude of change observed in these biomarkers in&#xD;
      children receiving an established behavioral weight-loss intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL)&#xD;
      intervention on DEXA-measured whole body adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic&#xD;
      (AP)-treated children compared to nonpsychiatric (NP) overweight or obese healthy controls,&#xD;
      and in AP-treated youth randomized to monthly Usual Care (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a BWL intervention on PDFF in&#xD;
      overweight/obese AP-treated children compared to NP overweight or obese healthy controls, and&#xD;
      in AP-treated youth randomized monthly UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a weekly behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      intervention on CIMT in overweight/obese AP-treated children compared to NP overweight or&#xD;
      obese healthy controls, and in AP-treated youth randomized monthly UC.&#xD;

A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean of a reference population (i.e., healthy, age and sex-matched children). Negative numbers indicate values lower than the reference population and positive numbers indicate values higher than the reference population.</description>

          <title>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)</title>
          <description>This instrument is a five-factor scale comprising 58 items under the categories of (I) Irritability, Agitation, Crying; (II) Lethargy, Social Withdrawal; (III) Stereotypic Behavior; (IV) Hyperactivity, Noncompliance; and (V) Inappropriate Speech. The 15-item Irritability subscale score ranges from 0 to 45. The cut-off of ≥ 18 on this subscale will identify individuals that are 1.3 to 1.5 SD above the mean. A lower score is better.The total score can range from a minimum of 0 (no problem behaviors) to a maximum of 174, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome/more symptoms.</description>

Behavioral Weight Loss: This intervention is a family-based, behavioral weight loss program that has been employed in studies with overweight and obese children, as well as with children who have diabetes. For the proposed study, the program has been modified to fit the needs of disruptive and behaviorally disturbed youth and their families. The modified program includes 16 weeks of weekly visits with a study interventionist, and supplemental phone contacts as needed. Phone contacts will only replace in-person visits if absolutely necessary to achieve the visit.</description>
