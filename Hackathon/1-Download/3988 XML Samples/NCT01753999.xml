  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine the possible underlying causes of sleep apnea (a disorder&#xD;
      in which there are problems with breathing during sleep) in World Trade Center Responders.&#xD;
      The study will look at the relationship between sleep apnea and various nose and throat&#xD;
      conditions. Specifically, the study will look at upper airway disease (problems with the nose&#xD;
      and throat), nasal inflammation, and nasal resistance (the amount of airflow through the&#xD;
      nose). Subjects will have a physical exam and answer questions about nasal symptoms and&#xD;
      sleeping problems. Nasal lavage (washing the inner nasal passages) will be performed on the&#xD;
      subjects and markers of inflammation will be measured in the lavage fluid. Rhinomanometry&#xD;
      (measuring the airflow through the nose) will also be performed to measure the degree of&#xD;
      airflow obstruction. All subjects will be asked to perform in-home sleep apnea monitoring.&#xD;
      Those subjects who are diagnosed with sleep apnea will test two treatment methods. Sleep&#xD;
      apnea is treated by using a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device. This device&#xD;
      blows air into a mask worn by the patient during sleep. The two treatment methods that will&#xD;
      be tested are the fixed pressure CPAP (pressure is constant during use) and CPAP-flex&#xD;
      (pressure decreases when the subject exhales). Patients will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      treatment method for one month then crossed to the other treatment method for the next month.&#xD;
      The investigators will determine if patients with certain nasal conditions (high nasal&#xD;
      resistance) are more likely to use CPAP-flex rather than CPAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster, an estimated 40,000 individuals were exposed&#xD;
      to significant amounts of dust while working in rescue, recovery and debris removal. A&#xD;
      significant number of these responders have reported least one new or worsened upper airway&#xD;
      respiratory symptom when examined in 2004 with 50% of responders continuing to have symptoms&#xD;
      of chronic rhino-sinusitis or upper airway disease (UAD) in 2007. In addition, about 50% of&#xD;
      those with UAD referred to our sleep center reported new onset snoring on their&#xD;
      questionnaires immediately following their exposure and had unusually high prevalence of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that did not appear to be related to obesity, which is the&#xD;
      usual risk factor for OSA. This suggests to us that mechanisms other than obesity may be&#xD;
      important in the pathogenesis of OSA in these subjects. Given their chronic nasal symptoms&#xD;
      they also provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between nasal pathology&#xD;
      and OSA and test if nasal symptoms reported by the subjects in the WTC Health Program (WTCHP)&#xD;
      are an indicator of increased nasal resistance due to nasal inflammation resulting from&#xD;
      exposure to the WTC dust. Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the standard therapy for OSA but&#xD;
      despite its efficacy has poor adherence. Subjects with high nasal resistance (such as&#xD;
      responders with UAD and OSA) may experience additional pressure during expiration at the&#xD;
      upper airway resulting in greater difficulty in tolerating CPAP therapy than those who do not&#xD;
      have high nasal resistance. Reduction of excess expiratory positive pressure by the modality&#xD;
      known as Cflexâ„¢ during CPAP therapy (CPAPFlex) may improve comfort and adherence in these&#xD;
      subjects without compromising CPAP efficacy. In the present proposal we will study responders&#xD;
      enrolled at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute of Robert Wood&#xD;
      Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) and the NYU School of Medicine Clinical Center of Excellence&#xD;
      at Bellevue Hospital&#xD;

          <description>Awake nasal resistance was measured using 4-phase-rhinomanometery (RhinoLab GmbH, Rendsburg, Germany) Total nasal resistance was calculated 1/[1/Rleft + 1/Rright] and then log transformed. Total nasal resistance (TNR) measured supine was used to stratify resistance using the median value of log[TNR]=0.8.</description>
