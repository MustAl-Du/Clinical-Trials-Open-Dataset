      This study aims to study use of viscosupplementation as a treatment of pain for young&#xD;
      individuals who are active. Typically viscosupplementation is considered an intervention for&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis often for older patients who are less active. Many young active patients&#xD;
      can also develop knee osteoarthritis after trauma or surgery or for congenital reasons.&#xD;
      Treatment of these patients commonly are steroid injections which have more biologically&#xD;
      detrimental effects for cartilage compared to viscosupplementation Synvisc One injections&#xD;
      which are a single injection will be used to determine effectiveness of reducing pain and&#xD;
      maintaining an active healthy lifestyle for younger patients aged 30-50 years old.&#xD;

      This study will be an open label longitudinal cohort study with natural history over 3 years.&#xD;
      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the cohort will have baseline functional testing performed including a&#xD;
      motion gait analysis, 12 minute walk test, and 3-day accelerometer data. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single 6 mL intra-articular injection of hylan G-F 20 in the target knee at&#xD;
      baseline. All ongoing treatments will be monitored at 6 month intervals over the 3 year&#xD;
      duration of the study. Patients can receive any other conservative treatments (e.g., oral&#xD;
      medications, physical or other therapy, acupuncture, etc., except other injection treatments)&#xD;
      and current treatments will be documented during each patient encounter. An initial injection&#xD;
      of hylan G-F 20 will be injected in the symptomatic knee using a standard supine lateral&#xD;
      approach using a 20 gauge needle. A face to face follow up visit will be carried out 6 months&#xD;
      after first injection with additional face to face meetings every 6 months thereafter unless&#xD;
      the subject requires an additional injection of hylan G-F 20. Hylan G-F 20 treatments can be&#xD;
      administered up to three times each year during the study duration. After each injection,&#xD;
      follow up measures will be carried out using secure e-mail or phone contact at 6 weeks, 12&#xD;
      weeks, 18 weeks after each in-office evaluation or injection. Follow up will consist of&#xD;
      WOMAC, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Patients may return for retreatment of hylan G-F 20&#xD;
      if symptoms recur after at least 4 months following their previous injection and they meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria with pain levels of WOMAC A1, C8, C9, C10 and/or C23 equaling 2 or&#xD;
      more. Patients requiring three injections of hylan G-F 20 in 4 months or less will be allowed&#xD;
      to exit the cohort after their six-month follow up following the third injection. Otherwise,&#xD;
      patients will be followed until they reach the 3 year follow up, or drop out for other&#xD;
      injection treatments or surgical treatment. Therefore, patients would potentially be able to&#xD;
      receive up to 9 injections during the 3 year study.&#xD;
