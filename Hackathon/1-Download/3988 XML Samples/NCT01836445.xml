  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) account for almost 70% of HIV diagnoses among all&#xD;
      young people in the U.S. and are alone in facing an increasing rate of infections. Because&#xD;
      YMSM are less likely to receive relevant sexual health education in traditional settings&#xD;
      (e.g. schools, community), the Internet is a unique route of reaching and helping YMSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different versions of an online HIV prevention&#xD;
      program for YMSM. The study is being conducted by researchers at Northwestern University in&#xD;
      Chicago, Hunter College in New York City, and Emory University in Atlanta. A total of 900&#xD;
      YMSM will be enrolled into this study from the clinics of community partners in Chicago, New&#xD;
      York, and Atlanta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two versions of the program. Some topics in&#xD;
      the program include HIV facts and myths, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and condom&#xD;
      use. All participants, regardless of the program version they receive, will also take at-home&#xD;
      urine and rectal tests for the STIs chlamydia and gonorrhea. After completing the program,&#xD;
      participants will be contacted three more times over the course of a year for follow-up&#xD;
      sessions and surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team hypothesizes that the YMSM-specific prevention program will lead to a&#xD;
      significant reduction in the frequency of unprotected anal sex acts and new STI infections&#xD;
      compared to the HIV knowledge program that is for a general audience. The YMSM-specific&#xD;
      program will also lead to improvements in secondary knowledge, motivation, and skills&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for the research team to measure the effectiveness of the YMSM-specific prevention&#xD;
      program and determine if the study hypothesis is correct, participants will be asked&#xD;
      questions about themselves, including questions about their sexual orientation, sexual&#xD;
      experiences, health practices, including drug use, health knowledge, and questions about&#xD;
      their feelings and emotions. Based on this information, the research team hopes to later&#xD;
      change, improve, or expand the program to better address the needs of YMSM.&#xD;

    <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.</description>

          <title>Keep It Up! Intervention</title>
          <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <title>Keep It Up! Intervention</title>
            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

          <title>Percentage of Correct Responses on HIV Knowledge Assessment at Baseline and 12 Months</title>
          <description>The change in number of HIV statements (e.g. &quot;Only the receptive/bottom partner is at risk of being infected with HIV during anal sex&quot;, &quot;There is a vaccine that can stop people from getting HIV&quot;, and &quot;A natural skin (lamb skin) condom works better against HIV than does a latex condom&quot;) correctly labeled as true or false at twelve months. All 26 statements were recoded such that correct responses = 1 and incorrect or 'don't know' responses = 0. Composite scores were calculated to reflect the percentage of correct responses. Higher scores reflect greater knowledge of HIV transmission/risk.</description>

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;

            <title>Keep It Up! Intervention</title>
            <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-29 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks. Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;
