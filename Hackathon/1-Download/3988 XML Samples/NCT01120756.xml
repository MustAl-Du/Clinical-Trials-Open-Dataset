  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the most common and disabling consequences of brain injury are deficits in cognition,&#xD;
      such as difficulty with sustained attention, memory, organization, and goal management. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this research program is to develop and test novel neuroscience-based&#xD;
      cognitive interventions for improving attentional regulation and related &quot;executive function&quot;&#xD;
      brain processes involved in goal-directed behavior.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury often results in a disruption of attention regulation processes, which reduces&#xD;
      the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive functions including learning, memory,&#xD;
      problem-solving and goal management, leading to significant functional disability. More&#xD;
      intervention options are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We set out to test different possible interventions. Individuals with traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI) and chronic executive control dysfunction participate in interventions, with pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention measurements of cognitive functioning. Training in Goal-oriented&#xD;
      attentional self-regulation (GOALS) was administered in comparison to Brain Health Education&#xD;
      (EDU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS is designed to train attention regulation skills along with meta-cognitive strategies&#xD;
      for goal management, with a emphasis on application to participant-selected projects. This is&#xD;
      a group-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain Health Education is designed to increase knowledge and understanding of key factors&#xD;
      that affect brain functioning. This is a group-based intervention matched to the GOALS&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline on a Composite Measure (Z-score) of Attention, Working Memory, and Executive Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Within 2-3 weeks Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We computed a composite measure based upon the average of individuals' scores on commonly used neuropsychological tests of attention, working memory, and executive functions. To compute this composite score, we first scored individual performances on each neuropsychological measure utilizing published norms, adjusted for, when available, age, gender, ethnicity, and education levels. We then converted all resultant scores (e.g., T-scores, Standard Scores) to a common metric, z-scores. (Z-scores are a standardized unit of measurement, scaled in terms of standard deviation (SD) units. Thus, a z-score of 0 represents the mean; a z-score of 1 represents+1 SD above the mean; and a z-score of -1 represents -1 SD below the mean.) Finally, for each participant, z-scores derived from each separate neuropsychological test were averaged together to yield a final composite score. The composite score was the unit of analysis.</description>

    <measure>Functional Evaluations: Change From Baseline on the Goal Processing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2-3 Weeks Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Observed measures of functional performance on complex tasks were assessed for the GOALS and Brain Health Education study. The overall composite score comprises scores for planning, initiation, self-monitoring, maintenance of attention, sequencing and switching, divergent thinking, execution, learning and memory. Scores range from 1-10. Changes were calculated from pre-to post-training, and higher scores indicate improvement in functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on a Composite Measure (Z-score) of Attention, Working Memory, and Executive Functions</title>
        <description>We computed a composite measure based upon the average of individuals' scores on commonly used neuropsychological tests of attention, working memory, and executive functions. To compute this composite score, we first scored individual performances on each neuropsychological measure utilizing published norms, adjusted for, when available, age, gender, ethnicity, and education levels. We then converted all resultant scores (e.g., T-scores, Standard Scores) to a common metric, z-scores. (Z-scores are a standardized unit of measurement, scaled in terms of standard deviation (SD) units. Thus, a z-score of 0 represents the mean; a z-score of 1 represents+1 SD above the mean; and a z-score of -1 represents -1 SD below the mean.) Finally, for each participant, z-scores derived from each separate neuropsychological test were averaged together to yield a final composite score. The composite score was the unit of analysis.</description>

This will involve 5-7 weeks of training (20 hours of group training (2 hour sessions, 2 days per week), 3 hours of individual training (1 hour at the beginning, halfway through and at the end of training), and approximately 20 hours of home practice). In brief, the GBSM training protocol is designed to maximize the potential for improving attention regulation skills and the goal-directed functions they support, applying mindfulness-based attention regulation training to practice in redirecting attention to goal-relevant processes especially in the context of distractions is emphasized throughout training. Participants are asked to identify realistic functional goals as feasible individual and group projects, and are then trained in goal management strategies on the functional task(s) of their choice.</description>

        <description>Observed measures of functional performance on complex tasks were assessed for the GOALS and Brain Health Education study. The overall composite score comprises scores for planning, initiation, self-monitoring, maintenance of attention, sequencing and switching, divergent thinking, execution, learning and memory. Scores range from 1-10. Changes were calculated from pre-to post-training, and higher scores indicate improvement in functioning.</description>
