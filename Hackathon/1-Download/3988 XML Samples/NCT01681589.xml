      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the relationship between attention and&#xD;
      emotional function post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in an effort to better understand the&#xD;
      cognitive mechanisms of emotional processing in patients with TBI, and explore novel&#xD;
      treatment strategies to improve emotional regulation using with transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) to modulate activity in the dysfunctional prefrontal-limbic circuits.&#xD;

      Thirty (30) individuals status post TBI with complaints of emotional dysfunction 6 months&#xD;
      post-brain injury and Fifteen (15) healthy controls will participate in the study. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive active tDCS for 20 minutes and computerized cognitive&#xD;
      training twice a week for 30-45 minutes for 6 weeks as described below. The control group&#xD;
      will receive sham-tDCS 20 minutes and computerized cognitive training for 30-45 minutes twice&#xD;
      a week for 6 weeks (12 training sessions). The sham group will not receive real tDCS after&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Patients meeting criteria to particpate in the study will be tested at baseline. During Visit 1, patients will be tested to measure how alert they are, their ability to perform actions one after the other and other mental functions. On Visit 2, patients will be tested on your ability to control your emotions. On Visit 3, patients will have a brain scan (MRI) to help the investigators understand how various parts of your brain are connected.</description>

          <title>Post Treatment Measures to Check Improvements</title>
          <description>Testing will be done again at the end of 6 weeks. This will allow the investigators to determine if there have been improvements in the patients attention and emotional function. The same assessments will be repeated again as with Visits 1-3. Investigators will ask questions regarding patients emotional well-being. An MRI will once again be performed.</description>
