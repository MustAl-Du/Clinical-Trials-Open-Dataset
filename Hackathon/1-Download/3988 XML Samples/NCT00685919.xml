  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to determine how changes in kidney dopamine (DA)&#xD;
      activity influence urinary sodium excretion. We will decrease DA activity in the kidney by&#xD;
      inhibiting DA synthesis via carbidopa administration. We want to compare findings in normal&#xD;
      volunteers and in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We will test the null&#xD;
      hypothesis (Ho) that the effects of oral carbidopa administration on urinary sodium excretion&#xD;
      will not differ between patients with POTS and healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will determine whether inhibition of renal dopamine formation by carbidopa administration&#xD;
      leads to a decrease in urinary excretion of dopamine and sodium and whether the response&#xD;
      differs in POTS and control populations. Carbidopa effects will be compared to those of a&#xD;
      matching placebo, and the sequence of treatments (carbidopa before placebo or placebo before&#xD;
      carbidopa) will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a complete history and physical examination, including an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After achieving sodium balance on a 200 mEq/day sodium diet, subjects will collect urine&#xD;
           over 24hr for baseline assessment of sodium and catecholamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On this day, the subjects will be admitted to the CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 18 gauge intravenous catheter will be inserted in order to draw blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects will fast from 7 pm until after the next morning's testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the morning, while still supine after the overnight sleep, heart rate and blood&#xD;
           pressure will be recorded, and blood will be drawn. The subjects will then stand for 10&#xD;
           minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at intervals, and an upright&#xD;
           blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects will be asked to collect their urine to end the 24hr urine collection.&#xD;
           Another 24hr urine collection will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A (Carbidopa 200mg or placebo) will be given orally following the void, at&#xD;
           approximately 7 am. Additional doses will be taken every 6 hours with the last dose at 7&#xD;
           am the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be free to follow their normal routine during the day until returning to&#xD;
           the CRC for the night. However, they will need to consume the 200 mEq/day study diet for&#xD;
           each meal, collect all urine, and take study medication on schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After returning to the CRC, the subjects will fast after 7 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the morning, supine and standing heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded, and&#xD;
           the subjects will be asked to collect their urine to end the 24hr urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final dose of study medication (Carbidopa 200mg or placebo) will be given orally&#xD;
           following the void, at approximately 7 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supine heart rate and blood pressure will be measured and supine blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected hourly for 4 hours after the treatment and at 8 hours after the treatment.&#xD;
           Subjects must rest supine for at least 30 minutes before each blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 2 hours after treatment, subjects will stand for 10 minutes for upright blood&#xD;
           pressure and heart rate measurements and collection of an upright blood sample, as&#xD;
           described above. Participants will be asked to rate the severity of common orthostatic&#xD;
           symptoms while supine and upright.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for two 4-hour periods after treatment and from 8 hours to 24&#xD;
           hours after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fixed-sodium study diet will be provided after the 4-hour measurements and in the&#xD;
           evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least a 1 day washout period, the study will be repeated with Treatment B&#xD;

        <description>Blood samples were collected while resting supine for at least 30 minutes and 2 to 4 hours after lunch. For catecholamine measurements, blood was collected in chilled vacuum tubes with EDTA. Plasma was separated and stored with added reduced glutathione (Amersham International PLC) at -70°C until the assay. Plasma catecholamines were measured by a method that involves batch alumina extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for separation with electrochemical detection and quantification.</description>
