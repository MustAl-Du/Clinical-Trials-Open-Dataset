  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objectives of this research are to develop effective treatments to reduce&#xD;
      unplanned pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) for a highly under-served&#xD;
      at-risk youth population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention designed to improve&#xD;
      contraceptive use and decrease STIs for at-risk youth for both those who do and do not want a&#xD;
      pregnancy. Those interested in becoming pregnant will be counseled in the risks associated&#xD;
      with teen pregnancy and what it means to have a healthy pregnancy and raise a child. The&#xD;
      investigators will utilize Title X programs in Rhode Island to provide reproductive health&#xD;
      services in the community. The investigators will recruit 325 at risk youth from Juvenile&#xD;
      Justice programs, alternative schools, group homes, and Community Mental Health Centers and&#xD;
      randomize them to two interventions: two sessions of personalized MI or two sessions of&#xD;
      Awareness for Sexual Health (ASH), both delivered individually by trained counselors. MI is&#xD;
      based on the principles of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and on MI, an empirically&#xD;
      supported counseling technique designed to enhance readiness to change targeted behaviors.&#xD;
      ASH provides didactic information about contraception, STI prevention and abstinence, and is&#xD;
      intended to control for the effects of assessment and attention.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Continuous Use of Highly Effective Contraceptives Over 9 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Timeline Followback (TLFB): Contraceptive use was measured via a calendar recall for both interventions.Continuous use of highly effective contraceptives at 9 Month follow up is determined if a participant remains on a highly effective contraceptive for 9 months. A participant switching from one highly effective contraceptive method to another is recorded as maintaining continuous contraceptive use at follow-up if she switches methods during times when the original method is still effective.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Positive STI Test After A Baseline Negative Test.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Conducted STI testing for T. vaginalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis through urine specimen collection. If a participant is diagnosed with an STI at baseline the youth will be referred for treatment at a Title X clinic and will be retested at the next follow-up visit. Any positive test after a baseline negative test will be documented as an incident infection.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Initiated a Highly Effective Contraceptive Post Treatment in 9 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Timeline Followback (TLFB): The types of contraceptives used was captured via a calendar recall for both interventions. Initiation of highly effective contraceptives is determined if a participant ever endorses beginning a highly effective contraceptive at any time within 9 months.</description>

        <description>Using the Timeline Followback (TLFB): Contraceptive use was measured via a calendar recall for both interventions.Continuous use of highly effective contraceptives at 9 Month follow up is determined if a participant remains on a highly effective contraceptive for 9 months. A participant switching from one highly effective contraceptive method to another is recorded as maintaining continuous contraceptive use at follow-up if she switches methods during times when the original method is still effective.</description>
