      The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) secondary&#xD;
      infections (re-infections/re-activations) and the incidence of CMV primary infections in&#xD;
      adolescent females.&#xD;

    <description>This outcome was part of the assessment of occurrence of CMV secondary infections determined in all seropositive subjects. Two-fold and above increases&quot; category = subjects that had two-fold and above increases of anti-CMV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration. &quot;Four-fold and above increases&quot; = subjects that had four-fold and above increases of anti-CMV IgG concentration. The cut-off of the assay = 1.136 ELISA unit (EU)/mL. A seropositive subject is a subject for whom anti-CMV IgG antibodies were detected in serum sample collected at Month 0. CMV secondary infections are defined as either a viral reactivation or a re-infection with a new strain of CMV.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Enrolment was terminated once approximately 240 seropositive subjects were included in the trial, to obtain approximately 200 evaluable seropositive subjects. The number of seronegative subjects enrolled depended on the seroprevalence of the participating countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 369 enrolled subjects, 363 were female subjects and 6 were newborns of some subjects. Consent was signed for the newborns to allow testing for CMV disease. The objectives assessed the CMV infections in the adolescent females with a known serostatus (N=362); no demographics, outcome measures, or adverse events were assessed in newborns.</pre_assignment_details>

A seropositive subject is a subject for whom anti-CMV IgG antibodies were detected in serum sample collected at Month 0. CMV secondary infections are defined as either a viral reactivation or a re-infection with a new strain of CMV. Antibody concentrations were tabulated as geometric mean concentrations (GMC) and expressed as ELISA units (EU)/mL. The cut-off of the assay = 1.136 EU/mL.

CMV secondary infections are defined as either a viral reactivation or a re-infection with a new strain of CMV. Antibody concentrations were tabulated as geometric mean concentrations (GMC) and expressed as ELISA units (EU)/mL. The cut-off of the assay = 1.136 EU/mL. GMC was calculated on subjects meeting a two-fold increase or above (i.e.: subjects that had two-fold and above increases [including four-fold] of CMV anti-tegument IgG compared with previous time point).</description>
          <population>This analysis was performed on CMV seropositive subjects with available results and meeting the two-fold increase or above, at Month 36, from the According-to-Protocol cohort, which included all subjects who met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria for the study, who did not have any elimination criteria during the study and who complied with the study procedures.</population>

        <title>Anti-CMV Tegument Protein IgG Antibody Concentration of Seronegative Subjects</title>
        <description>This outcome is part of the assessment of occurrence of CMV primary infections determined in all seronegative subjects, on samples collected during the 4-month site visits until study conclusion. A seronegatve subject is a subject for whom anti-CMV IgG antibodies were not detected in serum sample collected at Month 0. CMV primary infection is defined as the first infection with CMV in subjects who were seronegative at enrollment. Antibody concentrations were tabulated as geometric mean concentrations (GMC) and expressed as ELISA units (EU)/mL. The cut-off of the assay = 1.136 EU/mL.</description>
