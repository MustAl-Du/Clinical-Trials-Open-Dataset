  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the short term effectiveness and return to function&#xD;
      of subjects undergoing primary Total Hip Arthroplasty using an Anterior Approach (incision on&#xD;
      the front part of the hip joint) versus Posterior Approach (incision over back part of the&#xD;
      hip joint).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anterior approach may provide better early post-operative outcomes because there are&#xD;
      fewer muscles at the front of the hip so the surgeon works between them rather than cutting&#xD;
      through muscle fibers. However, the anterior approach is more difficult to access so usually&#xD;
      requires a specialized table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The posterior approach is easier to access, but the incision cuts through muscle fiber. This&#xD;
      may lengthen recovery time. However, a specialized table, which can be quite expensive, is&#xD;
      often not required.&#xD;

    <description>Harris Hip 5-Year Total Score Change from Baseline. The Harris Hip score gives a maximum of 100 points. Pain receives 44 points, function 47 points, range of motion 5 points, and deformity 4 points. Function is subdivided into activities of daily living (14 points) and gait (33 points). The higher the Harris Hip score, the less dysfunction.This outcome measure has been validated for joint replacement surgery for peer reviewed orthopedic literature.</description>

          <description>Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) utilizing a modern fracture table with the patient placed supine, both feet in boots for proper positioning. Anterior skin incision, 10-14 cm long, is used. An inter-muscular plane is utilized to access the anterior hip capsule. The hip capsule is opened anteriorly, a femoral neck osteotomy is performed based on pre-operative templating, and the femoral head removed. Acetabular retractors are placed and reaming of the acetabulum commenced. This is done under direct visualization with C-arm confirmation for positioning. The femoral side is then visualized with the aid of the fracture table. A hydraulic trochanteric hook elevates the proximal femur. Broaching of the femoral canal is started and proceeds up to the appropriate size. A trial reduction is performed, and the length and offset are checked manually and with C-arm confirmation. The trial components are removed and the prostheses are placed with press-fit fixation. Routine closure is performed.</description>

          <title>Direct Anterior Approach</title>
          <description>Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) utilizing a modern fracture table with the patient placed supine, both feet in boots for proper positioning. Anterior skin incision, 10-14 cm long, is used. An inter-muscular plane is utilized to access the anterior hip capsule. The hip capsule is opened anteriorly, a femoral neck osteotomy is performed based on pre-operative templating, and the femoral head removed. Acetabular retractors are placed and reaming of the acetabulum commenced. This is done under direct visualization with C-arm confirmation for positioning. The femoral side is then visualized with the aid of the fracture table. A hydraulic trochanteric hook elevates the proximal femur. Broaching of the femoral canal is started and proceeds up to the appropriate size. A trial reduction is performed, and the length and offset are checked manually and with C-arm confirmation. The trial components are removed and the prostheses are placed with press-fit fixation. Routine closure is performed.</description>

          <title>Postero-Lateral Approach</title>
          <description>Postero-Lateral Approach (PA) uses a standard OR table with the patient placed in the lateral decubitus position. A 10-14 cm skin incision is utilized over the posterior-lateral corner of the hip. The gluteus maximus muscle is split in line with its fibers and the short external rotators and posterior capsule are opened. The hip is dislocated posteriorly and a femoral neck osteotomy is performed. The acetabular and femoral components are inserted in the same manner as is done with the DAA with press fit fixation utilized. The PA is well described in all major texts on orthopedic surgery.</description>
