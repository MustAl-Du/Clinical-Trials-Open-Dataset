      An intensive intervention of specially trained paraprofessionals, called community oral&#xD;
      health specialists (COHS), administering on a quarterly basis for 2 years fluoride varnish&#xD;
      and oral health promotion education, compared to usual care, will reduce decayed, missing,&#xD;
      and filled tooth surface measures at 2 years for children in American Indian Head Start&#xD;
      Programs.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design will be a clustered randomized design. Fifty-two head start classes in a&#xD;
      Southwest American Indian Reservation will be randomized, 26 to the intervention program and&#xD;
      26 to usual care. The intervention will be comprised of specially trained paraprofessionals,&#xD;
      called community oral health specialists (COHS), administering fluoride varnish and oral&#xD;
      health promotion education quarterly for 2 years. Baseline and annual measures of decayed,&#xD;
      missing, and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) of the children, and surveys of their caregivers'&#xD;
      dental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors will be completed. The study will be a 5-year&#xD;
      study, with 2 years for intake/accrual, and 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;
