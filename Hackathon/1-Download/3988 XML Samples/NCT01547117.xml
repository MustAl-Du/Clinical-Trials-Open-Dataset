    <textblock>
      Patients with POTS may not adequately expand their plasma volume in response to a high-sodium&#xD;
      (Na+) diet. Mechanisms involved in the regulation of plasma volume, such as the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal dopamine, may be impaired in POTS and may&#xD;
      respond inappropriately to changes in dietary sodium.The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine (1) whether a high dietary sodium level appropriately expands plasma volume in&#xD;
      POTS; (2) whether plasma renin activity and aldosterone are modified appropriately by changes&#xD;
      in dietary sodium in POTS; and (3) whether patients with POTS have improvements in their&#xD;
      orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms as a result of a high dietary sodium level.&#xD;

      Study Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start 150 milliequivalents (mEq) Na+/day diet (POTS patients as inpatients; healthy&#xD;
           control subjects with clinical research center (CRC)- provided outpatient diet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start a 24h urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood work&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood volume - carbon monoxide rebreathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete 24h urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start STUDY DIET (10 mEq Na+/day or 300 mEq Na+/day in a random order) after 3 meals of&#xD;
           150 mEq Na+/day are complete; water ad lib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 3 - 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue STUDY DIET; water ad lib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 5, a 24 hr holter combined ECG monitor will be placed on the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue STUDY DIET; water ad lib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove 24h Holter combined ECG monitor and BP monitor from subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start a 24h urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight for study next day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 7 (BIG DAY)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Awaken early (~6am) to void (still collecting 24h urine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient returns to bed, IV catheter inserted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posture Study (in morning; between 7-8am ideally)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured while supine and then while standing for&#xD;
           up to 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will draw 3 tablespoons of blood in each body position to measure hormones that&#xD;
           regulate blood pressure and blood volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormones to verify the subject's phase of menstrual cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum/plasma aliquots for future analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will rate symptoms during supine period and at end of stand using Vanderbilt&#xD;
           Orthostatic Symptoms Score (VOSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total Blood Volume (DAXOR)- using injection of iodinated I-131 tagged human serum&#xD;
           albumin nominally 25 micro-Ci of radiation blood samples drawn through IV catheter&#xD;
           before injection and for ~30 minutes post-injection (total - 25 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be done after supine assessment, but before standing the subject up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomic Function Test with Cardiac Output and Brief Tilt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject will be tilted up to 60-75 degrees head-up tilt for up to 10 minutes to&#xD;
           measure the changes in heart rate and blood pressure and symptoms with upright&#xD;
           challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood volume - carbon monoxide rebreathing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Capacity Test (in the afternoon) Will estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2&#xD;
           max) This test will be conducted on a stationary bicycle. Effort will be gradually&#xD;
           increase while expired air is measured during exhaustive physical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are repeated at least a month later with the 2nd level of dietary salt.&#xD;
      (Randomized to high or low salt to the first phase, the second phase is the remaining level)&#xD;

    <description>Plasma volume (PV) was determined by the indicator tracer-dilution technique, using the DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer (BVA)-100 system (DAXOR Corporation), on Day 7 of the low sodium and high sodium dietary interventions.

    <measure>Magnitude of Orthostatic Tachycardia</measure>
    <time_frame>Supine and upright heart rates were measured on Day 7 of High Sodium and Low Sodium diet.</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the magnitude of the heart rate increase that occurs in patients with POTS when moving from a supine to an upright position is attenuated by a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Heart rate was assessed after overnight rest and fasting after midnight, following at least 60 minutes of lying quietly. Heart rate was then measured at intervals after subjects had been standing for up to 30 minutes (as tolerated). Orthostatic tachycardia was calculated as the difference between standing and lying heart rates. Data are presented for 5 minutes standing (or maximal stand if &lt;5 minutes) since several patients were unable to stand for 10 minutes.&#xD;
Data in POTS patients were compared to that of Healthy Controls.</description>

    <measure>Upright Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Upright symptoms were assessed on the 7th day of diet.</time_frame>
    <description>Whether upright symptoms were improved in patients with POTS on a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Patients were asked to report their standing symptom burden at the end of the Stand portion of the posture study, using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptoms Scale (VOSS). They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum of 10. The sum of the scores for the 9 symptoms was used to measure orthostatic symptom burden. Higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

        <description>Whether the magnitude of the heart rate increase that occurs in patients with POTS when moving from a supine to an upright position is attenuated by a High Sodium diet relative to a Low Sodium diet.&#xD;
Heart rate was assessed after overnight rest and fasting after midnight, following at least 60 minutes of lying quietly. Heart rate was then measured at intervals after subjects had been standing for up to 30 minutes (as tolerated). Orthostatic tachycardia was calculated as the difference between standing and lying heart rates. Data are presented for 5 minutes standing (or maximal stand if &lt;5 minutes) since several patients were unable to stand for 10 minutes.&#xD;

Patients were asked to report their standing symptom burden at the end of the Stand portion of the posture study, using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptoms Scale (VOSS). They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum of 10. The sum of the scores for the 9 symptoms was used to measure orthostatic symptom burden. Higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

They rated the severity of nine symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, mental confusion, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, and nausea) on a scale from a minimum of 0 (reflecting an absence of symptoms) to a maximum of 10. The sum of the scores for the 9 symptoms was used to measure orthostatic symptom burden. Higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>
