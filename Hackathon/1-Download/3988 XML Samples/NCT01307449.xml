      Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing infectious diseases. Despite the success&#xD;
      of vaccines in general, vaccines induce diminished antibody responses and lower protection in&#xD;
      the elderly in particular. This could be explained by a defect in the early responses of an&#xD;
      ageing immune system. A better understanding of the basic immunological mechanisms that&#xD;
      mediate vaccine efficacy is incomplete. Such information is critical and could greatly&#xD;
      decrease both the cost and the time to new vaccine development particularly for the geriatric&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators will study the immunologic differences of two FDA approved&#xD;
      licensed pneumococcal vaccines between a younger and an older group. Twenty two healthy&#xD;
      volunteers between the age of 25-40 and sixty six healthy volunteers between the ages of&#xD;
      60-89 will be enrolled in the study. Each participant in the study will be given one&#xD;
      pneumococcal shot. Blood work will be obtained prior to vaccination, one day, three days,&#xD;
      seven days, fourteen days, as well as one month and six months after vaccination. Throughout&#xD;
      the duration of the study, the participants will be monitored for safety.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: PCV13 [13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar®13)] induces better&#xD;
      functional immune responses when compared to PPV23 [23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccine (Pneumovax®23)] in older naïve adults. We hypothesize that this is due to intrinsic&#xD;
      defects in innate responses that could explain the poor immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared&#xD;
      to PCV13. Therefore, we propose to extensively study innate and adaptive immune responses&#xD;
      generated after administration of either pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines in&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Single center, open label study in which adult healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      vaccinated with either PPV23 or PCV13. Blood samples will be collected on Days D0 (at&#xD;
      enrollment) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30 and D180 post vaccination to study innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though PPV23 and PCV13 are considered safe, volunteers will be asked to report any local&#xD;
      or systemic AEs from Day 0 (vaccination) to Day 7 . Reactogenicity events will also be&#xD;
      evaluated by injection site examination on visits at D0, D1, D3 and D7. Also volunteers are&#xD;
      asked to report any local or systemic AEs for 30 days post vaccination and any SAEs for 180&#xD;
      days post vaccination. Volunteers are also asked to report local and systemic AEs developing&#xD;
      the day of a blood draw.&#xD;
